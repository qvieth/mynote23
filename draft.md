workaholism:bad - work engagement:good -> X
-> motivational correlates of X + burnout

- structural equation modeling: `+|> positive correlate -|> negative correlate`

  - workaholism +|> introjected regulation && identified regulation
  - work enggagement +|> intrinsic regulation
  - burnout -|> intrinsic regulation
  - different motivational regulation |> different job-related well-being

- [self determination theory](self-determination-theory)

  - concern with the motivation beind choices
  - without external influence and interference
  - focuses on the degree to which human behavior is self-motivated and self-determined

- job-related well-being:

  - workaholism: state of mind that is uncontrollable inner drive to work hard
  - work enggagement: positive, fulfilling, work-related state of mind, engaged employees have by passion for their work
  - burnout: state of exhaustion in which workers are cynical about the value of their occupation and doubtful of their capacity to perform
    -> outcomes for employees, their spouses, and their companies

- In contrast to workaholic and engaged employees, employees experiencing burnout are not pushed or pulled to work. Rather, they have developed a mental distance towards their work.

# - SDT

social environment either support or thwart individual's growth tendency
behavioral regulation:

- autonomous vs relatively autonomous vs controlled

- varied form of extrinsic motivation
  - external
  - introjected
  - identified
  - integrated
- book p.16 they can be motivated by intrinsic and by varied types of extrinsic motivations
- wiki: A taxonomy of motivations have been described based on the degree to which they are internalized.
  - Internalization refers to the active attempt to transform an extrinsic motive into personally endorsed values and thus assimilate behavioral regulations that were originally external
- three basic psychological needs that must be satisfied to foster well-being and health: <- learn these by heart wiki
  - autonomy
  - competence
  - relatedness
- Basic needs theory (BNT): considers three psychological needs that are related to intrinsic motivation
- need for competence and autonomy is the basis of intrinsic motivation and behaviour. This is a link between people's basic needs and their motivations

- extrinsic
  - external regulation: least autonomous/ most controlled
  - introjected regulation: its regulation is introjected
  - identified regulation
  - intergrated regulation: most autonomous extrinsic motivation - goals that are trying to be achieved are for reasons extrinsic to the self, - rather than the inherent enjoyment or interest in the task.
- instrinsic motivation

  - needs of competence and autonomy

- intrinsic - self-determination - psychological needs fulfilled
- Self-Determination Theory (SDT) represents a broad framework for the study of human motivation and personality
- SDT proposes that the degree to which any of these three psychological needs is unsupported or thwarted within a social context will have a robust detrimental impact on wellness in that setting.
- SDT is an organismic dialectical approach. It begins with the assumption that people are active organisms, with evolved tendencies toward growing, mastering ambient challenges, and integrating new experiences into a coherent sense of self. These natural developmental tendencies do not, however, operate automatically, but instead require ongoing social nutriments and supports. That is, the social context can either support or thwart the natural tendencies toward active engagement and psychological growth, or it can catalyze lack of integration, defense, and fulfillment of need-substitutes. Thus, it is the dialectic between the active organism and the social context that is the basis for SDT’s predictions about behavior, experience, and development
- Within SDT, the nutriments for healthy development and functioning are specified using the concept of basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness.
- To the extent that the needs are ongoingly satisfied, people will develop and function effectively and experience wellness, but to the extent that they are thwarted, people will more likely evidence ill-being and non-optimal functioning. The darker sides of human behavior and experience, such as certain types of psychopathology, prejudice, and aggression are understood in terms of reactions to basic needs having been thwarted, either developmentally or proximally

- denial state, bargaining... where does this come from -> acceptance

- producitivity
- we glamourize workaholic because there is assumption that work = success then people who dedicate their life to work must be successful, or at least has the potential to be
- intense work culture
- there are people working harder than CEO of billion dollar company but they are... barely surviving, it's not simple as work harder, there's factors affecting these people
- The scary thing is that this really all starts when you are a kid/teen
- We do so many hours of homework in high school with so many extracurriculars so that we can even GET IN to college,
- never mind the jobs a lot of us have to work in order to pay for it.
- As a High School student, getting 5-6 hours of sleep is the norm, and if you get 7 or up, you are considered lucky.
- It’s so screwed up

- resource is limited,
- secure
- competing

  1. feeling compeled to work because of internal pressure
  2. persistent thought about work when not working
  3. working beyond what is reasonably expected, despite the potential for negative consequences

## method - nurse and physician

## notes: discussion part in presentation

- this study examines the correlation of different types of motivation defined in SDT and job-related well-being
- there are 4 interesting findings:
  1. workaholism +> extrinsic motivation , workaholism +> identified regulation
  2. work engagement +> intrinsic motivation
  3. work engagement +> extrinsic motivation
  4. burnout -> intrinsic motivation autonomous extrinsic motivation burnout +> introjected regulation for physician only, burnout are amotivated
- These findings support earlier findings that need satisfaction is negatively related to emotional exhaustion
- this study's suggestion: One explanation for this finding is that physicians have a strong and internalised ethic of responsibility (Wu, Zhu, Li, Wang, & Wang, 2008) that is, for instance, institutionalised in the Hippocratic Oath. As a result, physicians may feel they must work (i.e. work is a duty), whereas not working may induce negative feelings about oneself.
- As a result, physicians may feel they must work (i.e. work is a duty), whereas not working may induce negative feelings about oneself.
- This strong internalised work ethic may encourage the development of burnout, which could explain why physicians are among the occupational groups with the highest levels of burnout (Schaufeli, 2007).
- Whereas burned-out phy- sicians are primarily driven by introjected regulation, burned-out nurses are not driven by any of the motivational regulations in particular
- These findings contradict the assumption that burned-out employees’ behavior is motivated by both external and introjected regulation
- these findings suggest that nurses experiencing burnout are a-motivated. A-motivation manifests itself by acting without intent or refraining from any acting. It is the consequence of not valuing an activity, not feeling competent to perform it, or not believing that it will lead to a desired outcome (Ryan & Deci, 2000a). It seems plausible that burned-out employees are a-motivated because they distance themselves from their work to prevent further deple- tion of mental resources

## limitation

- One limitation of the present study is that all constructs were measured using self-reports
- Second, our data were collected among a relatively homogeneous sample of Chinese medical professionals
- Third, the present study used a cross-sectional design. -> However, the cross-sectional design did not allow us to examine the causal relations among these concepts

## theoretical and practical implications

The present study extends previous research in at least three ways.

- First, it is the first to uncover the motivational correlates of workaholism, work engagement, and burnout using SDT and to show that these correlates differ substantially and meaningfully.
  - Although workaholic employees are basically extrinsically motivated, engaged employees are both extrinsically and intrinsically motivated.
- Second, the present study provides indirect evidence for SDT’s assumption that human beings are active, growth-oriented organisms and that fostering this tendency leads to optimal functioning and well-being, whereas thwarting it leads to adverse outcomes.
- Third, the present study provides directions for practical use. Since work engagement is linked to beneficial outcomes at the individual and organisational levels
- The present study suggests that fostering autonomous motivation may simultaneously lead to an increase in work engagement and a decrease in workaholism and burnout.
- One way to achieve this is by making jobs more attractive and challenging to employees, and adopting an autonomy-supportive management style that includes being emphatic, offering choices, and providing meaningful rationales for doing particular tasks

## conclusion comments

examined the **motivational correlates** of workaholism, work engagement, and burnout
Finally, employees experiencing burnout are neither pushed nor pulled to work; rather, they distance themselves from their work.
