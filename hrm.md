  - discuss how the following trends are chianging the skill requirement for managerial jobs
    - increasing work-family conflicts
    - gender equality
    - respect for LGBTQ and other groups of minorities

- Workâ€“family conflict occurs when an individual experiences incompatible demands between work and family roles, causing participation in both roles to become more difficult
- flexible work arrangement, telework, shape the workforce
- what skill requirement do you need, empathy,
- hardskill: speak different languages, learn

- It is important for organizations and individuals to understand the implications linked to work-family conflict or discriminiation among workplace. Therefore the required skills for manager in response to the trends are to have empathy and attention to details: know how employee feel and figure out their struggle without hearing from them so that they can re-evaluate job specification to fit each individual.
- For example
  - manager who have attention to detail should create special treatment for woman who is pregnant like they should be prioritized in parking lot or elevator.
  - facilitate consolidarity or have warning towards employee who discriminate or uncooperate with other employee of LGBTQ or minorities groups.
