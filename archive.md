Crisis management is a process designed to prevent or lessen the damage a crisis can inflict on an organization and its stakeholders. As a process, crisis management is not just one thing.
Crisis management can be divided into three phases:
stakeholder: lawyers , employee

We use Situational crisis communication theory(SCCT), a theory in crisis communication, to categorize what type of crisis the company is facing, also the best strategy to deal with that specific crisis.

Defined by Coombs in his SCCT research, there are three identified types of crises or “crisis cluster”: the victim cluster, the accidental cluster, and the intentional cluster.

## (1) pre-crisis

already happen
Preparation involves creating the crisis management plan

## (2) crisis response

- That research has been divided into two sections: (1) the initial crisis response and (2) reputation repair and behavioral intentions.
- what management does and says after the crisis hits
- initial crisis response guidelines focus on three points:
- (1) be quick
  - the need for the organization to tell its side of the story.
  - appreciate the value preparation and templates
  - news media will lead the charge to fill the information vacuum and be a key source of initial crisis information
    - WHAT -> manage relation with news media -> open an interview -> stealing thunder
      - be honest, take responsibility
      - correct the mistake
      - The philosophy of IMC **speaking with one** voice in a crisis is a way to maintain accuracy.
      - it is physically impossible to expect one person to speak for an organization if a crisis lasts for over a day.
      - crisis team needs to share information so that different people can still convey a consistent message
      - news media is not the only channel crisis managers can and should use to reach stakeholders.
      - WHY
        - If the organization having the crisis does not speak to the news media, other people will be happy to talk to the media.
        - These people may have inaccurate information or may try to use the crisis as an opportunity to attack the organization
        - As a result, crisis managers must have a quick response
    - express concern/sympathy for any victims of the crisis
    - never forget employees are important publics during a crisis
- (2) be accurate
- (3) be consistent
  - Form refers to the basic structure of the response
- Table 4: Initial Crisis Response Best Practices
- Bill Benoit (1995; 1997) has done the most to identify the reputation repair strategies
- assess the reputational threat of a crisis

## (3) post-crisis

if the company we suggest it form a crisis management team -> pre crisis mangement plan
have a designated crisis management team
conduct exercises to test the plans and teams at least annually,
concerned with prevention and preparation
Both Barton (2001) and Coombs (2006) document that organizations are better able to handle crises when they
(1) have a crisis management plan that is updated at least annually,
(2) have a designated crisis management team that is properly trained
(3) conduct exercises to test the plans and teams at least annually, and
(4) pre-draft some crisis messages.
public relations, legal, security, operations, finance, and human resources

1.  Deliver all information promised to stakeholders as soon as that information is known.
2.  Keep stakeholders updated on the progression of recovery efforts including any corrective measures being taken and the progress of investigations.
3.  Analyze the crisis management effort for lessons and integrate those lessons in to the organization’s crisis management system

# My Answer:

## A. Learning to be aware of yourself isn’t always easy, but practicing this skill can help you become a true leader.
While answering the number 1 question about strengths, I tried different labels for my strengths like perseverance, fast-learner, or creative, but it just doesn't fit. I think to describe any strength I have to use a spectrum, like perseverance 70% chance in all situations, fast learning 60%, and creative 50%. Looking at my strength that way is quite subjective, as the value between 0 and 100 is quite feeling-based for me to come up with. Therefore, I try a different approach of how I look at myself

I'll look at what I value the most in my life, my core value, because what I value has a significant effect on what I believe, and therefore it guides my future behaviors. Answering the question this way, I think it is a more objective approach to looking at myself. Similar to the first question, other questions will be answered using the core value I developed here.

3 things I value the most are knowledge, change, and society.

In the past, there were moments I feel negative or just have no idea what the future will be like. Thanks to some random chance, the knowledge that matters appeared and change the way I look at the problem. In a general way, that is how I value knowledge. As a result of that belief, I'm always seeking knowledge. I want to change my status quo. I can't just rely on random chance to solve my problem; I have to actively seek the right knowledge pieces for solving the problem puzzle. Reading is my number one way of absorbing knowledge.

My experience tells me that, knowledge is not constant, it's not always true or all the time truth. I must keep an open mind. This is what I called change, I don't stick to a belief rigidly. I don't want to trust my common sense. Wasn't that how people believed, "the earth is flat, and the sun orbits around the earth"? From that, I know science is my religion. My belief always changes.

One more thing that I just recently value: society. From a young age, I was considered a shy kid. My teachers would see me as a math boy but never as a literature boy. Also, there's a stereotype at the time that said boys are good at math while girls are good at literature. It was BS, but I was young, and I believed that "truth". I labeled myself as a bad literature student. And you may know the result, I'm afraid of literature. What happens to a kid when they are not good at literature? I was bad at communicating and expressing myself. I always feel disconnected. This seems like an excuse for my social insecurity, but I think this is the best way, and somehow it reflects on my social phobia. Growing up, I worked hard, believing I could do anything. I was half-right. On my journey of absorbing knowledge, I realized I could do anything but not everything. After all, I have to connect to people and work together. The number 1 knowledge that I prioritize improving these days is emotional intelligence. According to Daniel Goleman, it has 5 basic areas of growth: self-awareness, managing emotions, self-motivation, empathy, and handling relationship; these areas are my current subject of study.


### 1. What are your strengths and gifts that create the most value?
My strength is what I value because that's what I believe I should improve: seeking knowledge, an open mind, and social intelligence(I'm still a shy boy, and it's hard for me to connect to people or speak publicly though; it is just I am looking into and trying to improve it a lot in the recent time). 


### 2. What are your vulnerabilities or development challenges?
Being shy, so shy that I still remember my first presentation when I was in secondary school, I was in an English presenting contest and the subject is about one's own family. The experience was frightening, that I was standing there like a stone. You may have guessed the result. My second presentation is in my freshman year, in the English class. Same result as that secondary year. It was bad also. I think the development challenge for me is to be working with people.

### 3. What would your dearest, most trusted friend or classmate say are your greatest strengths and your greatest weaknesses?

I asked my 2 best friends, Khuong and Tai, to share what they think about my strengths and weaknesses and these are their verbatim words:

```
KHUONG:
strengths: 
+ good in researching 
+ fast learner
+ businessman with the mind of a computer scientist
+ good taste of music, game, and many kind of entertainment
+ know bunch of places in town, a person will lead where to go, not follow.
+ interest in many good things like language, seminar, or technologies nowsaday.
+ good in debating and persuading
+ has friends who can share with him in many aspects (technologies, social, news)
* greatest strength: a fast learner, well-performed researcher, wonderful mindset.
weakness:
+ i will write later

TAI:
Đầu óc nhạy bén, tiếp thu có vẻ vượt bậc có thể gọi là điểm mạnh. tất cả thành thạo bộ môn đó nhanh
Điểm yếu thì trước mắt thì thấy như trên kiểu hay lựa chọn kém
- GOOGLE TRANSLATE + my revise would be:
Having a sharp mind, the speed at which acquiring knowledge seems to be fast. Can master most subjects quickly
Weaknesses: at first glance, seems to always make a bad choice
```
I have a big interest in technology, especially information technology, in fields like Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence. So I asked these friends who are computer scientists to share with me their roadmap or course list of their university so that I can study things about computer science in my free time. A method-driven mindset is the best thing I get from studying this field. That's why Khuong considers my strength as a businessman with the mind of a computer scientist. I'm so proud for him saying this is my strength.

That line about "good at debating and persuading" is definitely false. I mean, he only thinks that I'm good at debating and persuading only because the topic I debate is not his expertise. I'm not secure about my public speaking or debating skill, so this point drive that insecure boy inside me.

About the next comment about me having many friends, I was lucky as having a social network of friends who share ambitions, and also they work in different fields like IT, environment engineering, and business.

Both Khuong and Tai say I'm a fast learner. To be honest, I don't feel this is true at all. There is a time I binged learning computer science stuff for like 14 hours a day. 24 hours minus 6 hours of sleep and 2 hours of all other stuff. When I binge learning things, I learn more the normal. That is when I'm having a good emotional state. These days, my working ethic wasn't that good because of my current emotion. I have to say that my emotional stability is quite low. My friends just help me remember that weakness.

Tai said I always make poor decisions. I will talk to him later about this, but I think he's only right for like 10 percent. I trust myself, so I think I'm doing right...

### 4. What insights have your self-reflections reminded you of your strengths, gifts, and vulnerabilities?
The biggest insight is that I was privileged. I was lucky for being born where I was. Not everyone can have the same privilege as I had. Social location is important for child development. Social is important. Everyone is the way they are because of so many factors, and I have to respect that. If I ever judge a person or what they think, I must look from their perspective. I love to understand people

### 5. What have the traumas and privileges of your life taught you?
Being Verbally abused when I was a kid is a trauma that I remember. It taught me words should be spoken carefully with thought. Emotions are also contagious. I have to improve my emotional intelligence. Empathy is the gift I received from that trauma, as I know what it feels to feel not good. Doing good things for people and caring about their emotions is my other value.

### 6. Where do these strengths come from? Who has influenced you the most? What situations have influenced you the most?
These strengths come from my family, my social location, and some random chance. I appreciate my dad for his work ethic and my mom for her love for her children. I feel lucky for being born in the when and where I was born so that I have good friends, places, and experiences that form who I am. Wasn't all of those just merely random chance? I could be anywhere, anyone but not myself of today. I just feel privileged for everything. The reason why I'm telling this story is that because I couldn't look at life this way before I had a near-death experience. Being alive again tells me I have to live a meaningful life.

### 7. Recall the key peaks and valleys of your life. What have you learned from them?
When I was in my freshman year, my team and I have taken 1st place in a business competition. I thought it was the peak of life, I thought I was smart, a gifted kid. Just until the valley of my life, the near-death experience, that I learned I was arrogant, and every action has its consequences, for every evaluation there is opportunity cost so choose wisely. Turns out that valley is the true peak at which I found the purpose of my life.

### 8. Do people trust you? If they do, why? If they don’t, why not?
My mom and dad always trust me, they gave me what I call self-belief. Thanks to them, I now always believe in myself. Believe I could change the world with work ethic and love.

There are people believing in me, also there are not. But I know the first condition for others to believe in me is that I have to believe in myself first. I have a purpose, a drive. Also, I have an idea of what to learn to make people believe in me. Being reliable, being honest, and being socially intelligent are what I aim to become.

## B. What leadership style best describes you? Please explain. (30%)
Thanks to the leadership course by professor Walter C.H. Wang, I started to look into the way I lead myself and others. There's an important point in the lesson which is "don't micromanage". That point immediately reminds me of the past mistake when I was working as a leader of a team.

The result which I considered good at the time turns out it's not. my experience was that while leading others, I was a leader who would overlook all the detail and would take the work from the member if their work is not up to my standard. I wasn't trusting or empowering my members, I only care about the product.

Looking at what I valued or believed, and pondering the question about what leadership style best describes me, I now develop the future charismatics that I want to have to be a leader: a leader who values empathy and communication

The first step in being emotionally intelligent requires one to be able to aware of that person's emotions. Apply that understanding of emotion-awareness to people around you then you can have empathy. So there are these questions: "Is it a matter for a leader to care about the emotion? Shouldn't leader decisions shouldn't be based on emotion? Then why would empathy even matter?" Emotions are hardwired into the human brain as a part of their survival ability. Therefore, emotions affect people's everyday decisions, drives, productivity, or motivations. As a result, being an effective leader requires empathy as a must. Any decision should be based on empathy which is about other team members' feelings also.

Then communication is what I think not just a leader but any human on this earth should be able and willing to do. We, humans, survive and progress through civilization only because we are social animals. We communicate and work as a team not only to survive and but also to thrive. Communication is a process: from the moment two humans send each other signal through language, bodily or verbally, to later when they are no longer see each other, the communication is still happening as the communicating signal have been sent and those people are still processing the information. Goals, plans, or anything that requires understanding will be irrelevant or broken without proper communication. communication is the first step in creating understanding.

Using these 2 values, empathy, and communication, together with Hersey and Blanchard’s situational theory of leader style. I would consider my leadership style as Participating style: low task but high relationship behavior. But my leadership being participating style doesn't mean I will limit myself to that only style. As I will learn and experience, I will improve my approach so that I could create whatever change which does have the best value for all the team members.
