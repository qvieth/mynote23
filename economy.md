debt burden: ratio debt to income
debt > income -> not credit worthy
debt < income -> credit worthy

- [How The Economic Machine Works by Ray Dalio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0)
  - principles by ray dalio
  - must watch until understand -> rewatch and take note
  - made of few simple parts and lots of transaction,
  - 3 main forces that drive the economy:
    - productivity growth
    - short term debt cycle
    - long term debt cycle
    - laying them on top of each other create a good templete for tracking economic movement
    - simplest part of the economy: **transaction**
    - the economy is simply the sum of the transactions that make it up
    - each transaction consist of
      - a buyer exchanging **money** or **credit**
      - with the seller for **goods**, **services** or **financial assets**
- money + credit = total spending
- total spending drives the economy
- total spending / quantity sold = price
- that's it the transaction: the building block of the economic machine
- all cycles and all forces in an economy are driven by transactions
- so if we can understand transaction we can understand the whole economy
- a **market** consist of all the buyer and seller making transaction for the same thing
- for example there are: wheat market, car market, stock market, and market for millions of things
- if you add up all the total spending and total quantity sold you will have everything you need to know to understand the economy
- people business, banks and governments all engage in transactions the way described:
  - **exchange money and market for goods, services and financial assets**
- the biggest buyer and seller is the goverment consist of 2 important part:
  - central government that collects taxes and spend money
  - central bank which is different from other buyer and seller because it controls the amount of money and credit in the economy
    - central bank does this by **influencing interest rates** and **printing new money**
    - central bank is an important player in the flow of credit
- **credit is the most important part of the economy but the least understood**
  - most important because it's the biggest and most volatile part
- just like **buyers and sellers** go to the market to make transaction so do **lenders and borrowers**
  - lenders want to make their money into more money
  - borrowers want to buy something they can't afford, or invest in something like starting a business
  - credit help both lender and borrowers get what they want
- borrowers promise to repay the amount they borrow called **principle**, plus additional amount called **interest**

  - `amount repay = principle + interest`
  - when interest rate are high there are less borrower because the interest are higher thus more expensive
  - when interest rate are high there are more borrower because the interest are low thus cheaper

- why credit is important?
- because when a borrower receives credit -> he is able to increase his spending
  - **remember: spending drives the economy**
    - one person's spending is another person's income
    - think: every dollar you spend someone else earns, every dollar you earn someone else has spent, when you spend more someone else earns more
    - when someone earn more it make lenders more willing to lend him money because now he now creditworthy
    - credit worthy borrower: the **ability to repay(income)** and **colatteral**
  - productivity matters most in the long run
  - credit matters most in the short run
  - debt allow us to spend more than we produce when we acquire it and make us pay less than we produce when we have to pay it back

- in economy without credit, the only way to increase spending is to increase productivity
- when we borrow, we create cycles
- in order to buy sth  you can't afford, you need to spend more than you make
  - to do this you essentially borrow from your future self
  - everytime you borrow you create a cycle

- this is why understand credit is important
  - as it **sets into motion a mechanical, predictable series of events that will happen in the future**
- this make **credit different from money**
  - money is what you make transactions with
  - when you **buy a beer with cash** the transaction is settled immediately
  - but when you **buy a beer with credit**
    - you're saying you promise to pay in the future
    - together you and the bartender create an asset(credit) and a liability(debt)
    - you just create credit out of thin air
    - it's not until you pay the bar tab later that the asset and the liability disappear,
    - the debt goes away and the transaction is settled

- **the reality is what people called money is actually credit**
- credit is good or bad based on the purpose:
  - good when the credit is use to allocate resources, buy assets that generate income
  - bad when it doesn't generate any income

- remember you spend someone else earns so if you spend 10 other earn 10 then he can borrow 1 to spend 11 and other receive 11 and can borrow 1.1 to spend 12.1,... the trend keep going on
- remember borrowing create cycles, so if the spending goes up it will eventually goes down
  - this leads us into the **Short term debt cycle**
  - short term debt cycle has many phases
    - the first phase: spending continues to increase and prices start to rise
      - this happens because the increase in spending is fueled by credit
    - when the amount of spending and incomes grow faster than the production of goods -> price rise -> inflation

- central bank doesn't want too much inflation, it cause problem
  - when there's inflation it raise interest rate -> interest raised -> less people borrow money -> less spending -> price goes down -> deflation

- there you see the economy works like a machine
- in the short term debt cycle, spending is constrained only by the willingness of lenders and borrowers to provide and receive credit
  - when credit is easily available there's **economic expansion**(the growth in the cycle goes up)
  - when credit is easily unavailable there's **economic recession**(the growth in the cycle goes down)
  - note that the cycle is primarily control by the central bank
  - the short term debt cycle typically last 5-8 years and happens over and over again for decades
      

- ratio debt to income : **debt burden**
- less income -> less credit worthy -> less spending
  - debt repayment continue to rise ->  spending even drop further -> cycles reverse itself
- **long term debt peak**
- deleveraging -> less borrowing -> less spending -> less income -> less wealth -> less credit -> less borrowing
- deleveraging cycle is like recession but the difference here:
  - in recession interest rate can be lowered to save the day
- but in deleveraging the lowering interest rate doesn't work because interest rate already hits 0%
- think about the economy is not credit worthy just like the individual
- the problem is debt burden is too high and they must come down
- there are 4 ways this can happen 
  - cut spending
  - reduce debt (through **default**)
  - redistribute wealth
  - print money

- we saw this in every modern history
- what people thought money was just credit so when cre
- central bank can print money, but it can only buy fianancial assets
- central government can buy goods and  services and put money in the hands of the people, but it can't print money
- so in order to stimulate the economy, the 2 must cooperate:
  - buy buying government bonds, the central bank essentially lends money to the government
  - and allow it to run a deficit and increase spending on goods and services through its stimulus program and unemployment benefits
  - this increase people income as well as government debt
  however it will lower the economy's total debt burden
- 3 rules of thumbs:
  - don't have debt rise faster than income -> debt burnden will eventually crush you
  - don't have income rise faster than productivity -> you become uncompetitive
  - do all you can to raise productivity -> in the long run that's what matters most
