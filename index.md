Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.
Because almost everything — all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure — these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.
Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.
You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.

* This study examined the relationship between proactive personality and career success by surveying a sample of 496 employees (320 men and 176 women) from a diverse set of occupations and organizations. **Proactive personality was positively associated with both self-reported objective (salary and promotions) and subjective (career satisfaction) indicators of career success**. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that proactive personality explained additional variance in both objective and subjective career success even after controlling for several relevant variables (demographic, human capital, motivational, organizational, and industry) that have previously been found to be predictive of career outcomes. These findings were consistent using both self-report and significant-other ratings of proactive personality. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

social science vs data science vs computer science
computer scientist: method driven, into the business of prediction
social scientist: theory driven, we often use small designed data, and are in the business of explanation more than prediction.
wikipedia vs consulting expert
Their simple philosophy is that any difficult problem could have a mathematical representation
Thus the problem becomes how one can figure out how to represent, and quantify a problem

tools including data manipulation, interviews, primary and secondary research, and experimentation

## fleeting notes

- https://online.uwa.edu/news/emotional-psychology/
  - APA definition: Emotional experiences have three components: a subjective experience, a physiological response and a behavioral or expressive response.
  - Despite all the conflicting research and adaptations, most research acknowledge that there are a set of universal **basic emotions** with recognizable facial features.
  - **Complex emotions** have differing appearances and may not be as easily recognizable, such as grief, jealousy or regret. Complex emotions are defined as “any emotion that is an aggregate of two or more others.” The APA uses the example of hate being a fusion of fear, anger and disgust.

    - sadness and joy
    - anger and fear
    - expectation and surprise
    - trust and disgust
  - emotions can escalate or de-escalate
  - emotions tell us this is important to you so pay attention, so it's not about positive or negative feeling, it's about feeling that helps us wake up and engage with the world
  - use this wheel to figure out **WHY** you are experiencing the emotions, consider possible causes - emotion drive people, people can also drive emotion -> make sense, logic of feeling.

### atomic habits : automatic actions
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7lDrwYdZc
- tiny changes leads to complete differnt destination : think of plane fly
- systems over goals
- habit loops : cue -> craving -> response -> reward
     - the purpose of setting goals is to win the game. the purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game.
          > the ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of our identity

- when we solve problems in term of outcomes or result, we only solve them temporarily, but the chagne the system in a longer term, as a system level, we need to change our identity
- how to build habit:
  1.  **cue**: brain triggered, initiates actions
  2.  **craving**: provide motivational thoughts
  3.  **response**: habits we perform
  4.  **reward**: endgoal
- 4 laws of behavior change - vs current bad situation:
  1.  make cues **obvious** - invisible
  2.  make it **attractive** - fugly
  3.  make it **easy** - hard
  4.  make rewards **satisfy** - unsatisfied
- emphasis places on
  - systems rather than goals
  - identity rather than outcomes
  - small habits rather than drastic change

### 5 love languages - chapman summary

- https://www.verywellmind.com/can-the-five-love-languages-help-your-relationship-4783538 : words, time, physical, service, gifts

  - According to Chapman, the love languages also apply to your relationships with your kids, your co-workers, and even your friends.
  - Your love language also can change occasionally. For instance, if you had a bad day at work, you may prefer a hug from your partner rather than an encouraging word.
  - Once you know each other's love language, you will see that it is easy to put it into action
  - **healthy relationships** aren't born, they're developed through attention and effort

- my takeaway -> conformity vs individuality: conformity in good society is good, in bad society, it's bad, individuality can make the society better or worse

### emotional intelligence - daniel goleman

- emotional intelligence - daniel goleman: EQ matters more than IQ

  - 5 basic areas of growth - work on these to increase your IQ :
    1. self-awareness : **categorize emotions**
    2. managing emotions
    3. self motivation
    4. empathy -> 1 & 2 react to oneself's emotion -> **empathy: the ability to feel and react to other's emotion**
    5. handling relationships
  - lesson 1 : ventilation fallacy -> venting when you're **angry** prolong your **anger** (not apply to sad) -> deep breath, go for walk, reframe thoughts
  - lesson 2 : don't ruminate when you're **sad**, distract yourself instead -> depression is a low arousal state, exercise is a high arousal state
  - lesson 3 : the artful critique -> 1. be specific -> 2. offer a solution -> 3. do it face-to-face -> 4. show empathy
  - lesson 4 : emotional contagion

https://fourminutebooks.com/emotional-intelligence-summary/

> in a very real sense we have two minds, one that thinks and one that feels - daniel goleman

- rational vs irrational(emotional)

Here are 3 lessons about what emotional intelligence is, why it’s so important and how you can get more of it:

#### 1. Emotional intelligence rests on self-awareness and self-regulation.

- There are two parts to being emotionally intelligent. One is being emotionally self-aware. It simply means that you’re able to **recognize and label your feelings**
- The second part of the EQ equation is emotional self-regulation - means **choosing how or if to react to your feelings**

#### 2. A high EQ makes you healthier and more successful.

> For example, in the world of business and careers, students with higher levels of empathy seem to get better grades, even if their peers are just as smart
> That’s because they can better manage their feelings – for example being bored, but still doing their homework – and perform better in social settings,
> like knowing when to speak and when to be quiet in class.

#### 3. You can boost your EQ by mirroring other people’s body language and thinking optimistically.

1. Mirror other people’s body language.
2. Convince yourself that your failures result from things you can change. -> helps you become optimist

One way emotions do this is by helping us learn from our memories.
Our brains store experiences in a way that not only records facts, but also our feelings

### the social animal - elliot aronson:

- big idea: **It is only through acknowledging the biased faculties of our species that we can disarm them**

  - Lesson #1: Why Understanding People Is Important?
    - Know what drives, motivates, disgust them. What makes them angry, sad or what kind of thing will put a smile on their faces.
    - Therefore you can predict how people’s thoughts, feelings, and behaviors occur.
    - By doing so, you have the power to make others feel better and also make them perform beyond their own know limits.
    - **Take the needed time to observe the people around you. Take notes if you have to. It will be worth it.**
  - lesson #2: How Society Influence Us
    - The goal of conformity is to: Be ‘correct’ stay in the good graces of other people by living up to their expectations.
    - 3 kinds of social influence **responses**:
      - Compliance: Conforming to ideas, beliefs, etc from an outside force. e.g. Laws
      - Identification: Conforming to ideas, beliefs, etc from someone you relate to (identify if). e.g. Role Model.
      - Internalization: Conforming to the ideas, beliefs, etc that you conceive as part of your self-concept. e.g. Morals
  - Aronson’s First Law: “People who do crazy things are not necessarily crazy” i.e. some situational variables can move a great proportion of us “normal” adults to behave in very unappetizing ways.
  - **An opinion with an emotional component can be called an attitude**. Compared the only evaluative opinions, attitudes are extremely difficult to change.
  - To **stereotype** is to assign identical characteristics to any person in a group, regardless of the actual variation among groups members.
  - **If a person goes through a painful experience in order to attain some goal or object, that goal or object becomes more attractive.**
  - If two people are genuinely fond of each other, they will have a more satisfying and exciting relationship over a longer period of time if they are able to express whatever negative feelings they may have than if they are completely “nice” to each other. In the long run, **authenticity** is essential for the maintenance and growth of the attraction between people!
  - Most people are motivated to justify their own actions, beliefs, and feelings.
  - **Cognitive Dissonance**: a state of tension that occurs whenever an individual simultaneously holds two cognitions (ideas, attitudes, beliefs, opinions) that are psychologically inconsistent.
  - If an individual makes a statement of belief that is difficult to justify externally, he will attempt to justify it internally by making his attitudes more consistent with the statement.
  - Nonconscious Ideology: a set of beliefs that we accept implicitly but of which we are unaware because we cannot even conceive of alternative conceptions of the world.
  - We like to be liked: the more insecure we feel, the more we appreciate being liked and consequently, the more we like someone who likes us
  - Groups effective at inducing conformity:
    1. Experts.
    2. If members are important to the individual.
    3. If members are comparable to the individual in some way.
  - It’s an important difference.
  - In compliance, the behavior changes only until the group or threat is present (albeit permanence can be increased with a commitment to stay within the group and if we discover our changed behavior is good for us)

- https://thepowermoves.com/the-social-animal/

  - Factors That Increase Conformity : for more read the link
  - Elliot Aronson defines social psychology as:
    > “the influences that people have upon the beliefs, feelings, and behavior of others”.
  - Does Conformity Change Minds? it depends
  - he argues a position opposed to his or her self-interest
  - Individuals who are both expert and trustworthy influence us.
  - **Trustworthiness (and effectiveness) can be increased if his arguement does not seem to be trying to influence our opinion.**
  - read Real-Life Applications parts : many insights
  - PROS: One of the biggest advantages of “The Social Animal” is that you get a solid overview over the whole field of social psychology

### thinking fast and slow - daniel kahneman

- [thinking fast and slow - daniel kahneman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqXVAo7dVRU) : 1. fast, automatic, irrational, automatic vs slow, logic -> 2. anchoring -> 3. the science of availability -> 4. loss aversion -> 5. framing -> 6. sunk cost fallacy (your past decisions shouldn't affect what is good for you now)

### blink

1. intuition(subconscious) vs conscious,
2. thin slicing through information: limited amount of argument but still make acurate judgement, know a moment without knowing why
   > there can be as much as value in the blink of an eye as in months of rational analysis

### peak - anders ericsson: **naive practice**(doing something over and over) -> **purposeful practice** -> **deliberate practice**

- big idea from long string remembering case: **rapid progress -> hitting perceived limit -> prolonged frustration -> sudden breakthrough -> loop**
- 4 components of purposeful practice : clear goal -> **focus** -> immediate feedback -> get out of comfortzone (stretch zone)
- deliberate practice -> mental representations
  > mental representations explain the difference between novices and experts
- purposeful practice + expert coaching = deliberate practice(also improve the process little bit for personal preference) : better and faster than purposeful practice
- [Peak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoUHlZP094Q)
  - naive practice
  - purposeful practice
    - 4 key components of purposeful practice
    - mental represenation
  - deliberate practice
  - 10000 hours what? purposefully or deliberately not naively
  - self aware and passionate

### predictably irrational

     - “Wouldn’t economics make a lot more sense if it were based on how people actually behave, instead of how they should behave?”
     - The price of zero causes people to react irrationally.
     - When the price is set to free, people take things they don’t need and forego better deals because they think ‘free’ comes at no cost.
     - Giving up on our long-term goals for immediate gratification is procrastination.
     - The more work you put into something, the more ownership you begin to feel for it.

### influence the psychology of persuasion

The book explains the psychology of why people say “yes” and how to apply these understanding
You’ll learn the six universal principles, how to use them to become
a skilled persuader — and how to defend yourself against them. j
https://medium.com/power-books/influence-the-psychology-of-persuasion-a-book-summary-7ae0ebf8950f
Here are the 6 main principles explored in this book:

1. Reciprocation
2. Commitment & Consistency
3. Social Proof
4. Authority
5. Liking

   - Very simply, this just means we prefer to say yes to the requests of people we know and like. factors that cause one person to like another person? tet

   1. Physical Attractiveness
   2. Similarity: We like people who are similar to us, whether it’s sharing opinions, personality traits, background, lifestyle, groups etc.
   3. Compliments: We generally love getting compliments, even if they’re not true
   4. Contact: We like things that are familiar to us. On the other hand, we often fear what we don’t know.
   5. Cooperation: We like people who work with us, instead of against us. Working together towards a common goal and being “on the same side” are very powerful.
   6. Conditioning & Association: what you want to prove is that YOU are better than the other person. Whomever you root for represents YOU; and when he wins, YOU win.

6. Scarcity

### stumbling on hapiness

     - The book tries to help you become self-aware of these tricks your brain plays on you, so you can avoid them in the future and thus create your own happiness.
     - 3 major takeaways:
          1. Your brain is really bad at filling in the blanks, but it keeps on trying.
          2. You should always compare products based on value, never on past price.
          3. Bad experiences are better than no experiences.

- https://jamesclear.com/book-summaries/stumbling-on-happiness

  > “They only think they’re happy because they don’t know what they are missing.”
  > That’s actually the point. Not knowing what we are missing is the very thing that allows us to be happy despite not having some other opportunity.

- What makes humans different from every other animal is that we think about the future.
- However, our brains fall victim to a wide range of biases
  - that cause our predictions of the future (and our memories of the past) to be **inaccurate.**
- Because of these mental errors it is remarkably difficult to predict what will make us feel happy

    - Emotions are often confused with feelings and moods, but the three terms are not interchangeable
      - A feeling is the result of an emotion and may be influenced by memories, beliefs and other factors.
      - A mood is described by the APA as “any short-lived emotional state, usually of low intensity.” Moods differ from emotions because they lack stimuli and have no clear starting point
      - Defining emotions is a task that is not yet complete. Many researchers are still proposing theories about what makes up our emotions, and existing theories are constantly being challenged.
      - Still, there’s a good basis of knowledge to analyze when exploring the topic.
    - American Psychological Association(APA) defined emotion as a reaction pattern involving:
      - subjective experience: aka stimulus
      - and physiological response: reaction, result of autonomic nervous system
      - behavioral response: result of the emotional process
    - our ability to understand others’ behavioral responses plays a huge role in our emotional intelligence, which will be discussed in more detail later.
    - https://www.verywellmind.com/what-are-emotions-2795178
    - That is why it’s important that we’re able to understand emotions as they play such an important role in how we behave.
    - Emotional intelligence is the ability to perceive, control and evaluate emotions
    - The term was first coined by researchers Peter Salovey and John D. Mayer and found popularity through Dan Goleman’s 1996 book
    - Emotions motivate people to respond quickly to stimuli in the environment, which helps improve the chances of success and survival.
