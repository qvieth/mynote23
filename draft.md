  - The second step is to review the **\*intensifying factors** of crisis history and prior reputation. If an organization has a history of similar crises or has a negative prior reputation, the reputational threat is intensified.
    - For crises with low attributions of crisis responsibility and no intensifying factors, add excuse and/or justification strategies to the instructing information and care response.

Crisis management is a process designed to prevent or lessen the damage a crisis can inflict on an organization and its stakeholders. As a process, crisis management is not just one thing.
Crisis management can be divided into three phases:
stakeholder: lawyers , employee

We use Situational crisis communication theory(SCCT), a theory in crisis communication, to categorize what type of crisis the company is facing, also the best strategy to deal with that specific crisis.

Defined by Coombs in his SCCT research, there are three identified types of crises or “crisis cluster”: the victim cluster, the accidental cluster, and the intentional cluster.

## (1) pre-crisis

already happen
Preparation involves creating the crisis management plan

## (2) crisis response

- That research has been divided into two sections: (1) the initial crisis response and (2) reputation repair and behavioral intentions.
- what management does and says after the crisis hits
- initial crisis response guidelines focus on three points:
- (1) be quick
  - the need for the organization to tell its side of the story.
  - appreciate the value preparation and templates
  - news media will lead the charge to fill the information vacuum and be a key source of initial crisis information
    - WHAT -> manage relation with news media -> open an interview -> stealing thunder
      - be honest, take responsibility
      - correct the mistake
      - The philosophy of IMC **speaking with one** voice in a crisis is a way to maintain accuracy.
      - it is physically impossible to expect one person to speak for an organization if a crisis lasts for over a day.
      - crisis team needs to share information so that different people can still convey a consistent message
      - news media is not the only channel crisis managers can and should use to reach stakeholders.
      - WHY
        - If the organization having the crisis does not speak to the news media, other people will be happy to talk to the media.
        - These people may have inaccurate information or may try to use the crisis as an opportunity to attack the organization
        - As a result, crisis managers must have a quick response
    - express concern/sympathy for any victims of the crisis
    - never forget employees are important publics during a crisis
- (2) be accurate
- (3) be consistent
  - Form refers to the basic structure of the response
- Table 4: Initial Crisis Response Best Practices
- Bill Benoit (1995; 1997) has done the most to identify the reputation repair strategies
- assess the reputational threat of a crisis

## (3) post-crisis

if the company we suggest it form a crisis management team -> pre crisis mangement plan
have a designated crisis management team
conduct exercises to test the plans and teams at least annually,
concerned with prevention and preparation
Both Barton (2001) and Coombs (2006) document that organizations are better able to handle crises when they
(1) have a crisis management plan that is updated at least annually,
(2) have a designated crisis management team that is properly trained
(3) conduct exercises to test the plans and teams at least annually, and
(4) pre-draft some crisis messages.
public relations, legal, security, operations, finance, and human resources

1.  Deliver all information promised to stakeholders as soon as that information is known.
2.  Keep stakeholders updated on the progression of recovery efforts including any corrective measures being taken and the progress of investigations.
3.  Analyze the crisis management effort for lessons and integrate those lessons in to the organization’s crisis management system
