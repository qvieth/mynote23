# Style, The Basics of Clarity and Grace - Joseph M Williams

## Preface

Whenever we reflect on what we do as we do it, we become self conscious, sometimes to the point of paralysis. You can avoid some of that paralysis if you remember that these principles have little to do what how you draft, much to do with how you revise. If there is a first principle of drafting, it is to forget all advice about how to do it.

## Lesson 1: Understanding Style

> Having something to say, and say it as clearly as you can. That's the only secret of style.

### Clarity And Understanding

The book rest on 2 beliefs: It is good to write clearly, and anyone can do it.

The difficult, even daunting, tasks of writing clearly has challenged generations of writers who have hidden their ideas not only from their readers but sometimes even from themselves.

### The Lure Of Obscurity

> The keynote of a pretentious style is the elimination of simple verbs.(...) a verb becomes a phrase, made up of noun or adjective tacked on to some general-purposes verb. In addition, the passive voice is wherever possible used in preference to the active, and noun constructions are used instead of gerunds.

More concise :

> Pretentious writers avoid simple verbs. Instead of using one word (...), they turn the verb into a noun or adjective, then tack it onto a general-purpose verb.(...) Whenever possible, they use the passive voice instead of the active, and noun constructions instead of gerunds.

> A turgid and polysyllabic prose does seem to prevail in the social sciences.... Such a lack of intelligibility, I believe, usually has little or nothing to do with the complexity of subject matter, and nothing to at all to do with the profundity of thoughts. It has to do almost entirely with certain confusions of the academic writer about his own status

### Some Private Causes Of Unclear Writing

Some writers plump up their prose, hoping that complicated sentences will indicate deep thought. And when we want to hide the fact that we don't know what we're talking about, we typically throw up a tangle of abstract words in long, complex sentences

Others write graceless not deliberately but because they are seized by the idea that good writing must be free of the kind of errors that only a grammarian can explain. They approach a blank space not as a space to explore ideas, but as a minefield of potential errors. They creep from word to word, concerned less with their readers' understanding than with their own survival.

Others write unclearly because they freeze up, especially when they are learning to think and write in a new academic or professional setting. As we struggle to master new ideas, most of us write worse than we do when we write about things that we understand.(...) You will write more clearly when you more clearly understand what you are writing about.

But the **biggest reason** most of us write unclearly is that we don't know **when** readers will think we are unclear, **much less why**.

In all of this, of course, is a great irony: we are likely to confuse others when we write about a subject that confuses us. But when we become confused by a complex style, we too easily assume that its complexity signals deep thought, and so we try to imitate it, compounding our already-confused writing

### On Writing And Reading

This is a book about writing based on our ways of reading. Once you understand why you judge one sentence to be dense and abstract and another clear and direct, **you will know how to regconize not only when other's writing is more complex than deep**, but when yours maybe as well.

The principles here also serve you as you read. When you encounter difficult prose, you will know what to look for on the page to determine whether your difficulty comes from the necessary complexity of the material or the gratuitous complexity of the writing. If the latter, use these principles to mentally revise the abstract and indirect writing of others into something you can better understand (while giving yourself the silent satisfaction of knowing that you could have written it more clearly).

### On Writing And Rewriting

**A warning**: if you think about these principles as you draft, you may never finish drafting. Most experience writers get some thing down as fast as they can. Then as they revise their first draft into something clearer, they understand their ideas better.

Here they are (the principles).

## Lesson 2: Actions

> Everything that can be thought at all can be thought clearly. Everything that can be said can be said clearly.

### Understanding How We Express Judgements

> 1a. The cause of our schools's failure at teaching basic skills is not understanding the influence of cultural background on learning.

> 1b. Our schools have failed to teach basic skills because they do not understand how cultural background influences the way a child learns.

Most of us would call (1a) dense and complex, (1b) clear and direct. But those words don't refer to anything in those sentences; they describe how those sentences make us feel. When we say that (1a) is unclear, we mean that we have a hard time undertanding it; **we say it's dense when we struggle to read it.**

**The problem is to understand what is in those two sentences that makes readers feel as they do**. Only then can you rise above your too-good understanding of your own writing to know when your readers will think it needs revising. To do that, you have to know what counts as a well-told story.

### Telling Stories About Characters And Their Actions

Most reader think (2b) tells story more clearly than (2a), because it follows two principles:

- Its main characters are subjects of verbs.
- Those verbs express specific actions

#### Principle Of Clarity 1: Make Main Characters Subjects

Abstract subject vs Concrete subject

#### Principle Of Clarity 2: Make Important Actions Verbs

The verbs shouldn't be vague: like _was taking, occurred_

### Fairy Tales And Academic Or Professional Writing

Fairy tales may seem distant from writing in college or on the job. But they're not, because most sentences are still about characters doing things

3a. The Federalistsâ€™ argument in regard to the destabilization of government by popular democracy was based on their belief in the tendency of factions to further their self-interest at the expense of the common good.

| whole subject            | verb      |
| ------------------------ | --------- |
| the Fedralist's argument | was based |
| ... by popular democracy |           |

3b. The Federalists argued that popular democracy destabilized government, because they believed that factions tended to further their self-interest at the expense of the common good.

| whole subject/character | verb/action       |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- |
| the Federalists         | argued            |
| popular democracy       | destabilized      |
| they                    | believed          |
| factions                | tender to further |

Readers think (3b) is clearer for two reasons: the **characters** are **subjects**, and the **actions** are **verbs**.

Note as well that all those whole subjects are **short**, **specific**, and **concrete**

In the rest of this lesson, we look at actions and verbs; in the next, at characters and subjects.

### Verbs And Actions

Our principle is this: A sentence seems clear when its important actions are in verbs.

Readers will think your writing is dense if you use a lot of abstract nouns, especially those derived from verbs and adjectives, nouns ending in **-tion, -ment, -ence**, and so on, **especially when you make those abstract nouns the subjects of verbs**.

A noun derived from a verb or an adjective has a technical name: nominalization. Using lots of nominalization in an writing will result a turgid academic and professional style - style that feels abstract, indirect and difficult.

... But when you match characters to subjects and actions to verbs in most of your sentences, readers are likely to think your prose is clear, direct, and readable.

### Diagnosis And Revision: Characters And Actions

You can **use the principles** of verbs as actions and subjects as characters to explain why your readers judge your prose as they do. More important, you can also use them to identify and **revise** sentences that seem clear to you but will not to your readers. Revision is a three-step process: diagnose, analyze and rewrite.

#### 1. Diagnose

a. Ignoring short (four- or five-word) introductory phrases, underline the first seven or eight words in each sentence.

> **The outsourcing of high-tech work to Asia** by corporations means the loss of jobs for many American workers.

b. Then look for 2 results:

- you underlined **abstract nouns** as **simple subjects** (oursoucing).
- you underlined seven or eight words **before getting a verb**. (The outsourcing of high-tech work to Asia by corporations) (10 words).

#### 2. Analyze

a. Decide who your **main characters** are, particularly the flesh-and-blood ones.

b. Then look for the **actions** that those characters perform, especially actions in those abstract nouns derived from verbs.

#### 3. Rewrite

a. If the actions are nominalization, make them verbs.

b. Make the characters main subject of those verbs.

c. Rewrite the sentence with **subordinating conjunctions** such as **because, if, when, although, why, how, whether**, or **that**

### Some common pattern

You can quickly spot and revise **5 commons pattern of nominalizations.**

1. The nominalization is the **subject of an empty verb** such as **be, seems,** or **has:**
      > The **intention** of the committee is to audit the records.
2. The nominalization follows an empty verb:
      > The agency conducted an **investigation** into the matter.
3. both 1 and 2
4. A nominalization follows there is or there are:
      > There is no **need** for our further **study** of this problem.
5. Two or three nominalizations in a row are joined by **prepositions** (of, to,...):
      > We did a review of the evolution of the brain.

Steps to revise :

1. revise the nominalizations to a verbs **&&** replace the empty verb with the new verb.
2. identify characters that would be the subjects of those verbs **&&** make those characters the subject of the verb.
3. link the new clauses with a logical connection (subordinate conjuntions).

- pattern 5 - either leave the second nominalization as it is, or turn it into a clause beginning with how or why.

### A Qualification: Useful Nominalizations

You might think you should never use nominalization. But in fact, you can't write well without them. **The trick is to know which nominalizations to keep and which to revise**.

Compare actual verbs and nominalizations, whichever is shorter, more specific, more familiar, use it.

## Lesson 3: Characters

### The Importance Of Characters

Important characters should be short, specific. Readers will think your sententence is less clear if your subjects is not concrete but abstract.

**Here's the point**: Readers want actions in verbs, but they want characters as subject even more. We create a problem for readers when for no good reason we do not name characters in subjects, or worse, delete them entirely. It is important to express actions in verb, but the **first principle** of a clear style is this: make the subjects of most of your verbs the main characters in your story.

### Diagnosis And Revision: Characters

> Governmental intervention in fast-changing technologies has led to the distortion of market evolution and interference in new product development.

1. Underline the first seven or eight words.
      - Readers want to see characters not just in the whole subjects of verbs, as government is implied in governmental but as simple subjects.
2. Find the **main characters**.
3. Skim the passage for **actions** involving those characters, particularly actions buried in nominalizations.
      - Ask Who is doing What?

To revise, reassemble those new subjects and verbs into a sentence, using **conjunctions** such as **if, although, because, when, how, why**

> When a government intervenes in fast-changing technologies, it distorts how market evolve and interferes with their ability to develop new products.

**Here's the point:** The first step in diagnosing a dense style is to look at your subjects. If you do not see main characters as simple subject, you have to look for them. They can be in objects of prepositions, in possessive pronouns, or in adjectives. Once you find them, look for actions they are involved in. When you are revising, make those characters the subjects of verbs naming those actions. When you are reading, try to retell the story of the passage in terms of those characters and their actions.

### Reconstructing Absent Characters

Reader have biggest problem with sentences **devoid** of all characters:

> A decision was made in favor of doing a study of the disagreements

That sentence could mean either of these, and more:

> We decided that I should study why they disagreed.
> I decided that you should study why he disagreed.

Sometimes we omit characters to make a **general statement**.

But when we try revise that into something clearer, we have to **invent characters**, then decide what to call them. Do we use one or we, or name a generic "doer"?

But if you avoid both nominalizations and vague pronouns, you can slide into passive verbs

Reintroducing missing characters is a matter in which judgement is important, but in general, opt for the most specific character you can find.

### Abstraction As Characters

So far, I've discussed characters as if they had to be flesh-and-blood people. But you can tell stories whose main characters are abstractions, including nominalizations, **so long as you make them the subjects of verbs that state specific actions involving them**.

We can make a passage clearer if we tell its story from the point of view of a fresh-and-blood characters (I,we).

**Here's the point:** Most readers want subjects to name flesh-and-blood characters. But often, you must write about abstractions. When you do, turn them into virtual characters by making them the subjects of verbs that tell a story. If readers are familiar with you abstractions, no problem. But when they are not, avoid using lots of other abstract nominalizations around them. When you revise an abstract passage, you may have a problem if the hidden characters are "people in general." Try a general term for whoever is doing the action, such as **researchers**, **social critics**, **one**, and so on. If not, try we. But the fact is, unlike many other languages, English has no good solution for naming a generic "doer."

### Characters And Passive Verbs

More than any other advice, you probably remember Write in the active voice, not in the passive. That's not bad advice, but is has exceptions.

When you write in an active voice, you typically put

- the agent or the character **of an action** in the subject.
- the goal or the receiver **of an action** in the subject.

> I lost the money

The passive differs in three ways:

1. The subject names goal of the action.
2. A form of _be_ precedes a verb in its past participle form.
3. The agent or source of the action is in a by-phrase or dropped entirely.

> The money was lost [by me].

The term active and _passive_, _however_, are ambiguous, because they can refer not only to those two grammatical constructions but also to how those sentences make you _feel_. For example, compare these two sentences:

> We can manage problems if we can control costs.
> Problem management requires cost control.

Grammatically, both sentences are in the active voice, but the second _feels_ passive, for three reasons:

1. **Neither** of its **actions** - management and control - are **verbs**; both are nominalizations.
2. The **subject** is problem management, an **abstraction.**
3. The sentence lacks flesh-and-blood characters.

To understand why we respond to those two sentences as we do, we have to distinguish the technical, grammatical meannings of _passive_ and _active_, from their figurative, impressionistic meanings. In what follows, I discuss grammatical passives.

#### Choosing Between Active and Passive

Some critics tell us to avoid the passive everywhere because it adds words and often deletes the agent, the "doer" of the action. But the passive is often the better choice.

To choose between active and passive, you have to answer 3 questions:

1. **Must you readers know who is responsible for the action?**
      - Often, we don't say who does an action, because we don't know or readers **won't care**. For example, we naturally choose the passive in those sentences:
           - The president **was rumored** to have considered resigning.
           - Those who **are found** guilty can be fined.
           - Valuable records should always **be kept** in a safe.
2. Would the active or passive verb help your readers move more smoothly from on sentence to the next?
3. Would the active or passive give readers a more **consistent** and appropriate **point of view**? (POV from 1 subject)

Here's the point: Many writers use the passive too often, but it is useful in these context:

- You don't know who did an actions, readers don't care, or you don't want to know.
- You want to shift a long bundle of information to the end of a sentence, especially when doing so lets you begin with a shorter chunk of more familiar information.
- You want you readers to focus on a particular character.

#### The "Objective" passive versus I/We

Some scholarly writers claim that they cannot use a first-person subject because they must create and **objective point of view**.

Contrary to that claim, academic and scientific writers use the active voice and first-person _I_ and _we_ regularly

It is not true that academic writers always avoid the first-person _I_ or _we_.

#### Passives, Characters, and Metadiscourse

When academic writers do use first person, however, they use it in certain ways. Look at the verbs in the passages above. They fall into 2 groups:

- Some refer to research activities: _examine, observe, measure, record, use_. Those verbs are usually in the passive voice: _The subjects were obsereved_....
- Others refer not to the subject matter or the research but to the writer's own _writing_ and _thinking_: _cite, show, inquire._ These verbs are often active and so in the first person: _We will show_.... They are the examples of what called _metadiscourse_.

Metadiscourse is language that refers not to the substance of your ideas but to yourself, your reader, or your writing:

- your thinking and act of writing: _We will explain, show, argue, claim, deny, suggest, contrast, add, expand, summarize_ ...
- your reader's actions: _consider now, as you recall, look at the next example_ ...

Metadiscourse appears most often in **introductions**, where writers announce their intentions: _I claim that ..., I will show, We begin by...,_ and again at the **end**, when they _summarize_: _I have argued..., I have shown._ What distinguishes those actions is that only the writer can lay claim to them.

On the other hand, scholarly writers generally **do not** use the first person with verbs that refer to specific actions they performed as part of their research, **actions that anyone can perform**: _measure, record, examine, observe, use_. Those verbs are usually in the passive voice: The subjects were observed.... We rarely find passage like this:

> To determine if monokines elicited an adrenal steroidogenic reponse, I added preparations of ...

Most writers would use a passive verb, were added, to name an action that anyone, not just the writer, can perform:

> To determine if monokines elicited a response, **preparations of**... _were added_

**Here's the point**: Some writers or editors avoid the first person by using the passive everywhere, but deleting an I or we doesn't make a resercher's thinking more objective. We know that behind those impersonal sentences are still flesh-and-blood people doing, thinking, and writing. In fact, the first-person I and we are common in scholarly prose when used with verbs that name **actions unique to writer.**

### Noun + Noun + Noun

One more stylistic choice does not directly involve characters and actions but it can distort the match that readers expect between the form of an idea and the grammar of its expression.

But strings of nouns feel lumpy, so avoid them, especially ones you invent. Revise compound nouns of your own invention, especially when they include nominalizations. Just reverse the order of words and find **prepositions** to connect them.

## Lesson 4: Cohesion and Coherence

- cohesion and coherence is about passage, paragraph connections.

### Understanding Connections

So far, I've dicussed clarity as if we could achive it **just by mapping characters and actions onto subjects and verbs.** But readers need more than individually clear sentences before they think a **passage** "hangs together".

> 1a passage 1b passage

The first seems choppy, even disorganized; the second seems more connected.

But like the word _clarity_, the words _choppy_, _disorganized_, and _connected_ refer not to the words on the page but to how they make us _feel_. What is it about the _arrangement_ of words in 1a that makes us feel we are moving through it in fits and starts? Why does 1b seem to flow more easily? We base those judgements on two aspects of word order:

- We judge a sequence of sentences to be **cohesive** based on how each sentence ends and the next begins.
- We judge a whole passage to be **coherent** based on how all the sentences in a passage cumulatively begin.

### Cohesion

#### The Sense Of Flow

> 2a 2b

In context, our sense of "flow" calls not for 2a, the sentence, with the active verb, but for 2b, the one with the passive.

The reason is clear: the **last four words of the first sentence introduce important character**.

**Here's the point:** Sentences are cohesive when the last few words of one set up information that appears in the first few words of the next. That's what gives us our experience of flow.

#### Diagnosis and revision: Old Before New

In sentences, readers prefer to encounter old, familiar information before they encounter new, unfamiliar information. So:

1. **Begin sentences with information familiar to your readers.** Readers get that familiar information from two sources. **First**, they remember words from the sentences they just read. That's why in our example about black holes, the beginning of 2b coheres with the end of 1st sentence and the beginning of 3rd sentence coheres with the end of 2b. **Second**, readers bring to a sentence a general knowledge of its content.
2. **End sentences with information readers cannot predict.** Readers always prefer to read what's new and complex after they read what's familiar and simple.

### Coherence

#### A Sense Of The Whole

- Think of **cohesion** as pairs of sentences fitting together the way individual piecs of a jigsaw puzzle do (recall the black hole sentences).
- Think of **coherence** as seeing what all the sentences in a piece of writing add up to, the way all the pieces in a puzzle add up to the picture on the box.

Sentence is incoherence for 3 reasons:

1. The subjects of the sentences are entirely unrelated.
2. The sentences share no common themes or ideas.
3. The paragraph has no one sentence that states what the whole passage is about.

#### Subjects, Topics, And Coherence

#### Diagnosis and Revision: Topics

As with issues of clarity, you can't predict how readers will judge the flow of your writing just by reading it, because you know it too well. You must analyze it more objectively. This passage feels choppy, out of focus, even disorganized:

> Consistent ideas toward the beginnings of sentences help readers understand what a passage is generally about. A sense of coherence arises when a sequence of topics comprises a narrow set of related ideas. But the context of each sentence is lost by seemingly random shifts of topics. Unfocused paragraphs result when that happens.

Here's how to diagnose and revise such passsage:

1. Diagnose
      - a. Underline the first seven or eight words of every sentence in a passage, stopping if you hit the main verb.
      - b. If you can, underliine the first five or six words of every clause in those sentences.
2. Analyze
      - a. Do the underlined words constitute a relatively small set of related ideas? Even if you see how they are related, will your readers? For that passage, the answer is no.
      - b. Do the underlined words name the most important characters, real, or abstract? Again, the answer is no.
3. Rewrite
      - a. In most (not necessary all) of your sentences, use subjects to name their topics.
      - b. Be sure that those topics are, in context, familiar to your readers.

Here is that passage revised, with the new subject boldfaced.

> **Readers** understand what a passage is generally about when **they** see consistent ideas toward the beginnings of sentences, especially in their subjects. **They** feel a passage is coherent when **they** read a sequence of topics that focuses on a narrow set of related ideas. But when **topics** seem to shift randomly, **readers** lose the context of each sentences. When **that** happens, **they** feel they are reading paragraphs **that** are unfocused and even disorganized.

Now the subjects form a strong topic string: _readers, they, they, they, topics, readers, that, they [readers]._

### Avoid Distractions At The Beginning Of A Sentence

Here's the point: In most of your sentences (not necessarily all), start with the subject and make that subject the topic of the sentence.

## Lesson 5: Emphasis

### Understanding How Sentences End

#### Complex grammar

> 2a. Lincoln's chaim that the Civil War was God's punishment of both North and South for slavery appears in the last part of the speech.

> 2b. In the last part of his speech, Lincoln claims that God gave the Civil War to both North and South as a punishment for slavery.

Most readers prefer 2b, because it begins simply with a short **introductory phrase** followed by a one-word subject and a specific verb, then moves toward grammatical complexity.

#### Complex meaning

Another kind of complexity is in the meanings of words, especially technical terms.

> 3a 3b

Both passages use the same technical terms, but 3b is clearer to those who know nothing about the chemistry of muscles.

Those passages different in 2 ways. First, information that is only implicit in 3a is stated explicitly in 3b. More important, note how almost all the technical terms in 3a are toward the beginnings of their sentences and the familiar ones are toward the end.

The writer deliberately uses **metadiscourse** just to put a new technical terms at the end:

> **We terms these cells** lymphokind-activated killer (LAK) cells.

**Here's the point:** Your readers want you to organize your sentences to help them manage 2 kinds of difficulty:

- grammatical complexity
- semantical complexity

### Another New Term: Stress

In the last lesson, we said that the first few words of a sentence are especially important because they state its topic, what the sentence is "about" or "comment" on. The last few words of a sentence are also particularly important, because they receive special emphasis. You can senese that when you here your voice rise at the end of sentence to emphasize one syllable more strongly than the others:

> ...more strongly than the o'thers.

We have the same experience when reading silently.

We'll call this most emphatic part of a sentence its **stress.** How you manage the emphasis in that stress position helps establish the voice readers hear in your prose, because if you end a sentence on words that carry little meaning, your sentence will seem to end weakly:

In lesson 3 and 4, we saw how different subject/topics create different point of view (pp28-29,40-41). You can also create different stylistic effects by managing how your sentences end.

**Here's the point:** Just as we look to the first few words of a sentence for point of view, we look to the last few words for special emphasis. You can revise a sentence to emphasize particular words that you want readers to hear stressed and thereby note as particularly significant.

### Diagnosis And Revision: Stress

If you managed your subjects and topics well, you will by default put the words you want to emphasize toward the ends of your sentences.

#### 3 Tactical Revisions

1. Trim the end.
2. Shift peripheral ideas to the left.
3. Shift new information to the right.

#### 6 Syntactic Devices To Emphasize The Right Words

There are several syntactic devices that let you manage where in a sentence you stress units of new information. (You just read one of them.)

1. **There** shift. Some editors discourage all there is/there are constructions, but using them let's you shift a subject to the right to emphasize it.
      - [ ] **Several syntactic devices** let you manage where in a sentence you locate units of new information.
      - [x] **There are** several syntactic devices that let you mange where in a sentence you locate units of new information.
2. **Passive** (for the last time). A passive verb lets you flip a subject and object. -> useful for cohesion revision.
3. **What** shift. This is another device that shifts a part of the sentence to the right, thereby emphasizing it more.
      - [ ] We need a monetary policy that would end fluctuations in money supply, unemployment, and inflation.
      - [x] **What** we need **is** a monetary policy that would end fluctuations in money supply, unemployment, and inflation.
4. **It** shift. When you have a subject consisting of a long noun clause, you can move it to the end of the sentence and start with an it.
      - [ ] **That oil prices would be set by OPEC** once seemed inevitable.
      - [x] **It** once seemed inevitable that oil prcies would be set by OPEC.
5. **Not only X, but (also) Y (as well).** In this next pair, note how the but **emphasizes the last element of the pair:**
      - We must clarify these issues **and** develop deeper trust.
      - We must **not only** clarify these issues **but also** develop deeper trust.
           > Unless you have reason to emphasize the negative, end with the postive:
      - The point is to highlight our success, **not to emphasize our failures.**
      - The point is not to emphasize our failures, **but to highlight our success.**
6. **Pronoun substitution and ellipsis.** This is a fine point: a sentence can end flatly when you repeat a word that you used just a few words before at the end of a sentence, because the voice we hear in our mind's ear drops off at the end. If you read aloud the preceding sentence, this one, and the next
