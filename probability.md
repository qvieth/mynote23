# probability

# fleeting notes
- The probability distribution for a discrete random variable is a formula, table, or graph that gives all the possible values of x, and the probability p( x ) associated with each value.
- when mutually exclusive A \union B = A + B - (A \intersect B)
- when not mutually exclusive A \union B = A + B
- combination = permutation devided by `number of ways that you can arrange k people`

- what i need studying:
  - [probability - math antics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzfWUEJjG18)
    - 0 impossible to 1 certain
    - 0.5 as likely as not, less than 0.5 unlikely, more than 0.5 more likely
    - the more trials you do the closer you get to the expected probabilities
      - if you do just a few trials, the result might not end up very close to what you'd expect
      - but if you do more trials, you increase your chances of reaching the expected probability

## book: introduction to probability

- sample space S of an experiment is the set of all possible outcomes of the experiment
- an event A is a subset of sample space S, and we say that A occured if the actual outcome is in A
