# photography

- at it core, photography is about capturing light
- your camera can tell if there's bright light or if there's an absence of light
- light goes into your camera through the lens which has the aperture inside
-

## section 2: Exposure

- exposure: how bright or dark your image is
- a photo that is
  - too dark is called underexposed
  - too bright is over exposed
  - not too dark, not too bright but looks **natural** is properly exposed
- you can adjust exposure with your camera using:
  - aperture
  - shutter speed
  - iso
    - these 3 elements make up what called **exposure triangle**
    - each settings also affects different aspects of your photo:
      - like the depth of field
      - and motion blur
- one thing that **dramatically changes** how bright or dark our photos might be: **lighting**
- with most DSLR mirrorless and point-and-shoot cameras and even mobile phones, you will be able to adjust these setttings manually
- dropping auto and understanding how to photograph with your manual settings
- even if you use auto settings in the future which is sometimes a good idea
- knowing how your camera works is so important to understand how to take a great photo

### what is aperture(aka iris)

- the part of exposure triangle that controls how much light enters and is captured
- the hole inside the camera lens that lets in light
- -> more light let in when the hold is bigger

  - -> increase the size of your aperture make your image brighter
  - -> decrease the size of your aperture make your image darker

- how do we adjust the aperture:

  - the f-stop or f-number is a scale that represents the size of the aperture
  - f-number a method of describing the size of the aperture in each lens
  - this f-stop scale goes from F1 to F1.4 to F2 to F4 and beyond

- 2 potentially confusing things about this f-stop scale:

  - a smaller f-number = the larger aperture and vice versa
  - not all lenses can adjust to all aperture

- a kit lens is the lens that usually comes with the camera when purchased

- your aperture also affects other things like depth of field

- depth of field: how much(what plane of your vision) is in focus in your photo
  - is from 3 feet in front to 100 feet
  - what is in the wanted plane is in focus and anything beyond that is just blurred
  - so how does aperture(or f-stop) affect this

1. a smaller aperture has **deeper depth of field**

- meaning a smaller sliver of your scene is in focus

2. a wide open aperture has **shallower depth of field** than smaller aperture

1. \*so if you are shooting a wide open landscape and you want **everything in focus:**

- -> smaller your aperture -> deeper depth of field

2. \*if you're shooting a portrait and you want a **blurry** background

- -> wider your aperture -> shallower depth of field
- -> this shallow depth of field can make not-so-great photo look more professional
- -> **not all cameras** and not all lenses can open up to very wide aperture

- reminder: if you are opening up your aperture, you're actually making your f-stop smaller
- if you are closing down your aperture, you're actually making your f-stop bigger

### what is shutter speed

- a creative way to blur or freeze motion in your composition
- once light travels through your camera's lens and through the aperture
  - it go through your shutter
- think of shutter as a curtain that is blocking your camera's sensor from seeing the light
- when you press your camera's trigger release button or the shutter release button
- that big button take your photo
- the curtain or the shutter opens up and closes really quickly to let in light
- your camera only needs to capture a fraction of a second in bright light
- and that is how shutter speed is represented as a fraction:
  - 1/30 of a second, 1/60 of a second,... 1/125, 1/8000
