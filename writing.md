Sit back from the keyboard or notepad.
Sit back, and continue to think.
That’s where the writing gets done.

“You can only write regularly if you’re willing to write badly…
Accept bad writing as a way of priming the pump, a warm-up exercise that allows you to write well.”

- [what is a thesis statement](https://rasmussen.libanswers.com/faq/32467)
- Your thesis statement belongs at the end of your first paragraph, also known as your introduction.
- Your readers—especially your instructors—want to read writing that engages them. Consequently, you must write thesis statements that are **arguable, not factual**
- Statements of fact seem easy to write about because, well, they are easy to prove
- After all, they’re facts.
- The problem is that you cannot write engaging papers around statements of fact.
- Such theses prevent you from demonstrating critical thinking and analytical skills,
- which you want to show your instructor.
- If you were to write a paper around the next two statements,
- your writing would probably be quite dull because you would be restating facts that the general public already knows.
- Besides typical essay components like an introduction and conclusion, a good analytical essay will include:
     - A thesis that states your main argument
     - Analysis that relates back to your thesis and supports it
     - Examples to support your analysis and allow a more in-depth look at the issue
- In the rest of this article, we’ll explain how to include each of these in your analytical essay.
