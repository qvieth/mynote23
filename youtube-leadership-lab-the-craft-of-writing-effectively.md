- function clear -> organization -> persuasive -> valuable
- pick a field -> read article -> highlight important words -> know the people(readers) -> know what they doubt, what they value,
- valuable to the reader
- whatever you write should have the function of helping particular set of readers understand what they want to understand well.
- the function is to move the conversation forward, not to reserve it definitely.
- writing is a way for you to participate in conversation : not by sharing your thoughts or feelings, but to change others' thoughts or feelings
- the language is not about me, it's about her
- the language has many functions, but the language of academic pieces is not to communicate your ideas, it's to change the ideas in existing community
- problem -> instability -> words like but althought however anomaly 
- problem -> cost/benefit
- the background they need is the problem
