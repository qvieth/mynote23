## The basis of good writing

- Be the windowpane -> clarity
- Waste no time -> spend your time to save reader time
- Don't sound smart, be smart
     - We don't want our readers to have any extra work
     - Choosing sentence structure or fancy vocabulary so that you sound smart actually does just the opposite
     - **Your document become your writing instead of about your ideas.**

```
don't make your writing about your writing
make it about your ideas
```

- be authority - be confident
     - might -> will
     - could use -> need
- scaffold well to write well

```scaffold
-> always start with your purpose
blankpage -> purpose -> signpost -> draft -> revise
```

- grammars matter
- don't repeat words
