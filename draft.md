workaholism:bad - work engagement:good -> X
-> motivational correlates of X + burnout

- structural equation modeling: `+|> positive correlate -|> negative correlate`

  - workaholism +|> introjected regulation && identified regulation
  - work enggagement +|> intrinsic regulation
  - burnout -|> intrinsic regulation
  - different motivational regulation |> different job-related well-being

- [self determination theory](self-determination-theory)

  - concern with the motivation beind choices
  - without external influence and interference
  - focuses on the degree to which human behavior is self-motivated and self-determined

- job-related well-being:

  - workaholism: state of mind that is uncontrollable inner drive to work hard
  - work enggagement: positive, fulfilling, work-related state of mind, engaged employees have by passion for their work
  - burnout: state of exhaustion in which workers are cynical about the value of their occupation and doubtful of their capacity to perform
    -> outcomes for employees, their spouses, and their companies

- In contrast to workaholic and engaged employees, employees experiencing burnout are not pushed or pulled to work. Rather, they have developed a mental distance towards their work.
