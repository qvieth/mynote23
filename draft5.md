Hypothetical GM's Hummer SWOT Matrix

|            | opportunity | threat |
|------------|-------------|--------|
|            | a           | b      |
| strength   | c           | d      |
| weaknesses | e           | f      |

- a. opportunity for Hummer in China: 
  - China's infrastructure of roads and buildings have been improving lately
  - China had been building its infrastructure of roads and buildings at an unprecedented rate
- b. competition from new & foreign automaker
  - demand is limited in china due to premium pricing and taxes of 100% from chinese government imposed on foreign-produce-vehicles
  - model size differcult to get through narrow and congested roads
  - government polices were not favourable to Hummer
  - Attack by Environmentalists
  - Oil Spike
- c. as china's road improving, SUVs model size becoming suitable
- d. Hummer is an American iconic brand
  - primarily a US-focused brand of rugged SUVs and SUTs,
- e. struggling financial situation
- f. Hummer's parent company long car-development lead times
    - slow in responding to customers’ changing preferences for more fuel-efficient cars,
  - low brand differentiation among parent's company core products
  - high salary cost, low work productivity
  - customer lifestyle changes
  - increasing oil prices and tightening government regulations on car emissions prompted rapid growth in compact and subcompact sedans at the expense of larger vehicles, including crossover SUV

- Meanwhile, China, with 1.3 billion people
and a booming economy, had experienced strong growth in sales of light vehicles since 2001.
- highly fragmented auto industry with manufacturers of all sizes auto
- New entrants were discouraged from entering the industry due to government control in issuing new vehicle-production licences, though a company could get around this by buying a small auto manufacturer that already had a valid licence. Therefore Tengzhong acquiring Hummer could be a strategy to get around the government discouragement.

- Business vision/mission
  - transform Hummer from a US-focused brand into a global icon and expand its presence in China.
  - invest heavily in Hummer to make it a real global brand,”

## Synergy
- major issues faced by Tengzhong included a lack of investment capital and the low fuel efficiency of Hummer vehicles. In case a production line for Hummer was to be set up in China, Yang assured that the company would comply with the country’s environmental policies
