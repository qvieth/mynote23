## An Experiment to Test Chocolate Preference

- how could i improve this project result

-> compare the result

### pseudo science

- 85 90 95
- hypothesis:
  - people who like sugar will prefer the chocolate with most sugar content
- quesiton:
  - do you like sugar ->
  - which cholate is the bitterest -> test reliability
  - which chocolate you like the most -> the result
- varible that couldl affect the outcome:
  - which chocolate taste first
  - their healthy life style
- How I thought of this project
  I'm trying to do a science project from sratch knowing nothing, just do it with anything came to my mind
  i love chocolate and but i'm a healthy addict
  chocolate that have above 85%
- I wanted design quick and not cost so many money experiment -> the purpose of doing this bad experiment is to see what bias did come to this experiment, how could i improve the experiment and how can i minimize the trade off of adding improvment to this project
- To test chocolate preferences,
  - I conducted an experiment on my friends by having them taste a 3 variety of chocolates.
  - They were told that they were in an tasting chocolate experiment
  - and I wanted them to rank their preference of each of 3 chocolates
  - Three of my friends were not raised in America which provided some interesting information on the differences in chocolate preference
  - between Americans and people from other parts of the world.
  - Through my experiment I discovered how texture, Fair Trade or organic labels, gourmet or artisan labels,
  - and the distinct taste of Hershey’s chocolate affected preferences.
    healthy chocolate -> which has the best taste
- principle for buying chocolate: -> economic model

  - cheapest ->
  - brand ->

- this experiment can be called a pseudo science
- the purpose of this experiment is not to be in an attempt to set up a controlled experience with as little changing variables as possible,

  - I decided to make all the samples I gave my friends look exactly the same.
  - I break down the 3 types of chocolate bars I bought into pieces
  - I did not want my friend’s preferences to be affected by product names or the shape/appearance of the chocolate.

- question to see who review is reliable
  - which is bitterst
- which do you like the most

### real science
