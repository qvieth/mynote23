  - APA definition: Emotional experiences have three components: a subjective experience, a physiological response and a behavioral or expressive response.
  - Despite all the conflicting research and adaptations, most research acknowledge that there are a set of universal **basic emotions** with recognizable facial features.
  - **Complex emotions** have differing appearances and may not be as easily recognizable, such as grief, jealousy or regret. Complex emotions are defined as “any emotion that is an aggregate of two or more others.” The APA uses the example of hate being a fusion of fear, anger and disgust.

  - the plutchik wheel was constructed **based on phisiological reaction**, not based on the meanings of feelings, which is another nuance
    - sadness and joy
    - anger and fear
    - expectation and surprise
    - trust and disgust
  - emotions can escalate or de-escalate
  - emotions tell us this is important to you so pay attention, so it's not about positive or negative feeling, it's about feeling that helps us wake up and engage with the world
  - use this wheel to figure out **WHY** you are experiencing the emotions, consider possible causes - emotion drive people, people can also drive emotion -> make sense, logic of feeling.
