[business case](business-case)

now i will share our findings on these problems which Tom is facing

After considering we came to the solution that Tom should negotiate with Shannon for another position in the company
tom seems very good at a saleman but since he's promoted it's been a bit of challenge for him

tom has a lot of good ideas,
it's was like frank was out to get him

decision criteria:

- tom is creative and talent, he has the need to be autonomous
- tom is knowledgeable about kisoks business -> has the position to negotiate with Shannon/ leaving the compny would be a loss for both company and Tom himself
-
- shannon warrant tom from the beginning
