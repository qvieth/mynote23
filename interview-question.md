# interview question

Recently in my thesis, which is about using statistical models to calculate the risk spillover effect of fintech on other industries. Many problems appear and knowledge gaps I have to fill. Eventually, I have to deal with a problem that needs me to collect data on all stock companies in my country. I was using my research skill and finally complete the collecting data task using python to request data and process them.
