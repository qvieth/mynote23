[writing](writing)
> A frequent offense we witness with bloggers is an outdated, useless, lame or ugly about page.
my current wrting flow : -> i keeep writing and prolong the tail of ideas, not have a scaffold, skeleton, purpose, outline yet

* write your purpose, main topics first -> then research -> then make an checklist for that topics
to introducemy self, i would like to talk about the ideas that form and shape who am i:

### open source
* imagine you own a restaurant, you restaunrant is best in town with the special chicken soup
* no one can ever make the chicken soup like you, you have no competitor
* but now you decide to publish your recipe, the secret formula for that chicken soup. After that, everyelse can easily replicate the **soup()** you make
* of course if you feel that everyone, not only the rich one, should have the oportunity to taste that soup you created, then by "open source" the formula, you have make the "chicken soup" progress one move forward -> make this point clearer
* but if you simply just want to keep your business stable, monopoly, less competitor, then keep hiding your recipe, that's not any thing bad or immoral.
* i won't drive deep down to the philosophy of open source, although that would be a really interesting topics, i might later write a post about this, but for now, i want to expressing my gratitude to the human who have act selflessly, share the knowledge to the world, just for the sake of humanity technological progress.(cough nikola tesla.. cough.. thank you idol)
by mentioning opensource, i'm not only mean ... about software, but also i want to open the professors, philanthopist who have create many Open courses for student to access free knowledge, a few example for this would be edx, coursera, havardx, mic ocw, and thousand more of pages, professor ( dr. chuck ) out there
thank you dr chuck for being the first person who guide inspire me to the access open knowledge.

### we are all human
from the age til now, i was consided a silent boy(not for those friends who really close to me though),

- what lead me to creating this blog? -> my first blog : a self introduction
- eating a really delicious chicken soup,
- open source, mooc, free lesson, also free book, i do read book that is illegal, but i will take that as a priviledge, by reading book i do have moral value, if you find these points of me disgust you, then sorry for wasting your time, i suggest you some other great blog which is the main teacher, inpirator for me to write -> huyen chip, thepresentwriter -> a little bit about these blogger

i do buy some native books, really like it, later when i'm rich definitely donate to all the opensource community and organization working on free education,
