Dear Richard,

Thank you so much for that lovely DVD you sent me. I'm a big fan of Batman Series and this DVD is the only one I haven't had for the set. You must have chosen this DVD so thoughtful. That's really kind and warm pal.

Are you free on the next Saturday or Sunday? If so could you let me know if you would like to come to my place so that we could watch this movie together? I shall be really happy seeing you again next week. Please feel free to also invite your friend hence we could have a small party.

Dear Clara

Everytime I received your letter, I was happy Clara. But for this time hearing you are moving to my city for studying, I was joyous! I wanted to go to your city someday so that I could meet you, but you just did it first!

Students in our country are diligent, also oftentimes competiting in terms of academic perfomance. Therefore you would feel an energetic and vibrant environment when you study here. In addition, each University also have many student associations in which you can join and spent time doing meaningful activities with other students.

Another pros is that job prospect for university student is plentiful. You could become a english instructor, translator, or many other jobs that require english as a skill. Our people love to have friends from other country. They will treat you with 

There's also many place you can travel and have fun in this city. Could i be your tourguide when you're here? I would love to do so.

In your freetime, you could choose to go to library, join student clubs' activity, or go along the city for food. Vietnam are really famous for our cuisine.

Also, could you let me know the expected time when you would be here? I shall prepare and welcome you with the best spirit of vietnamese friendliness. I'm looking forward to receive news from you.

Sincerely,
Ho Tan Tai

1. Why does Akamai need to geographically disperse its servers to deliver its customers’ web content?
In the modern internet era, internet user's patience for loading website is very low. Reports state that users would leave a page of which loadtime is greater than 3 seconds. Akamai solve the content delivery network problem by move the server to near the user so that copies of web content at many different locations can be serve to a nearest user. Therefore the web is loaded faster.

2. If you wanted to deliver software content over the Internet, would you sign up for Akamai’s service? Why or why not?
website served by Akamai service are 4 to 10 times faster than the non-service-used one. This is a attractive reason for using akamai service. but as a business owner, one has to do cost-benefit analysis to decide whether the service is worth using.

3. Do you think Internet users should be charged based on the amount of bandwidth they consume, or on a tiered plan where users would pay in rough proportion to their usage?
From the standpoint of user, i will pick whatever solution is more benefit for me. As a heavy-use internet user, i prefer the pay for bandwidth i consume solution.
