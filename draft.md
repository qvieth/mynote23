# How would you act in the following situations? Why? How is your personal value system reflected in your choice?

student name Jason - id 08913935

By applying ethical theories in to how i consider my ethics,
I would consider my ethics as universal ethics, which mean my action will based on the idea that people should be treated with dignity and respect, my actions will be taken out of duty and obligation to a purely moral ideal rather than based on the needs of the situation. To answer the below questions i will use the value i develop here.

## 1. You buy a candy bar at the store and pay the cashier with a $5 bill. You are mistakenly given change for a $20 bill. What do you do?

It's my duty to return the mistaken change money. Doing so i'm treating people with dignity and respect.

## 2. You are riding in a taxicab and notice a $20 bill that has obviously fallen from someoneâ€™s wallet or pocketbook. What do you do?

As i know police won return the money therefore i will ask the taxi driver to do it for me. It's his decision to keep or return it, either way I'm making the taxi driver happier.

## 3. You live in a small Midwestern town and have just lost your job at the local bookstore. The best-paying job you can find is at the local meatpacking plant, but you are a vegetarian and feel strongly that killing animals for food is unjust. What do you do?

I will find another job with less-paying but doesn't conflict with my ethics value. I might consider being a prostitute.

q5: Would you have agreed to participate in this study? Why or why not?
Given the information that i would have to hurt other human beings, I would not agree to participate in the research. Not only this is against my personal value which is not do things that harm others, but also it could be that the research would cause me trouble with law if the situation didn't turn out that every one in the research is the actor and the electric shock was fake.

q6: Do you think if the study were repeated today we would get the same kind of results? Why?

As the article has sugested, there are research data that suggest ordinary human beings are capable of performing destructive and inhumane acts without any physical threat of harm to themselves. Also many research has show that authority will significantly influence every individual human's decision. Therefore i think if the study were repeated today we would get the same kind of result.
