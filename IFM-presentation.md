## inflation status quote in US

- [NEXT LISDE] U.S. inflation hit its fastest pace in nearly four decades last year as pandemic-related supply and demand imbalances, along with stimulus intended to shore up the economy, pushed prices up at a 7% annual rate. That was the fastest since 1982 and marked the third straight month in which inflation exceeded 6%.

- [NEXT SLIDE] The so-called core price index, which excludes the often-volatile categories of food and energy, climbed 5.5% in December from a year earlier. That was a bigger increase than November’s 4.9% rise, and the highest rate since 1991.

- [NEXT SLIDE] Prices for autos, furniture and other durable goods continue to drive much of the inflationary surge, fueled by largely pandemic-related imbalances of supply and demand that most economists expect to fade as Covid-19’s impact on economic activity eases. Prices of used cars and trucks soared 37.3% in December from a year earlier, while living room, kitchen and dining room furniture jumped 17.3%.

- [NEXT SLIDE] here is some comment by Central Bank about the situation: Omicron is an economic threat, but inflation is even worse
- [NEXT SLIDE] omicron has worsen the labor shortage, drive up the cost for companies, these effects from omicron also worsen the cost-push inflation situation, which mean it rise the cost of raw material for the company there for push the price even higher

## [NEXT SLIDE]effect of inlation on financial market

### [NEXT SLIDE]BONDS

- some article from new york times about the bond market situation in these inflation times
- Affected by high inflation and the interest rate increasing, the bond market is having a horrendous year — producing painful losses on a scale last seen in the 1980s.

- **SKIP** Although the global bond market dwarfs the stock market, measuring the declines in bonds in an easily understandable way is tricky, partly because no bond index possesses the name recognition of the Dow Jones industrial average or the S&P 500 stock index.

- **SKIP** One benchmark for the **investment-grade U.S. bond market** has been called the Bloomberg Aggregate Bond index since August.

- [NEXT SLIDE] There is an benchmark for the bond market called Bloomberg Agrregate Bond index, and it was down 6.2 percent this year. That puts it on a course for its worst quarterly performance since 1980

- These poor returns aren’t limited to the U.S. bond market. They are global in scope, as are their causes

- The Bloomberg Global Aggregate index, a comparable measure of global bonds, was down 6.6 percent so far this year, one of the worst since that index’s inception in 1990, according to Bloomberg.

- The culprit for the sharp decline in bond values **is the rise** in interest rates that accelerated throughout fixed-income markets in 2022

### [NEXT SLIDE] STOCK

Those historically bad bond returns are nothing compared with the periodic collapses of the stock market. For example, in February and March 2020, the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, the S&P 500 fell nearly 33 percent in just 23 trading days. Still, bad bond returns combined with poor stock market returns in the same stretch leaves many diversified stock and bond portfolios in a state of distress.

The Vanguard Balanced index fund, a plain vanilla mixture of 60 percent stock and 40 percent bonds, is down 5.8 percent for the year. Bonds, which generally serve as a buffer that insulates investors from the volatility in their stock holdings, have not performed that function well this year.

- [NEXT SLIDE] Higher inflation is looked on as a negative for stocks because it Increases borrowing costs, increases input costs (materials, labor), and reduces standards of living
- UNEXPECTED INFLATION IS THE PROBLEM
- Reduces expectations of earnings growth, putting downward pressure on stock prices => Prices will likely drop.

## where to put money

### 1. TIPS

TIPS stands for Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities. It
mirror the rise and fall of inflation.

### 2. CASH

Setting aside 6-9 months for 1-or-2-income households in a
high-yield savings account, money market account, or CD.

### 3. SHORT-TERM BONDS

Similar strategy as maintaining cash in a CD or savings
account. Your money is safe and accessible.

### 4. STOCKS

Stocks can be good as a long-term inflation hedge but can
suffer in the short term if inflation spikes

### . REAL ESTATE

traditionally does well during periods of higher inflation, as
the value of property can increase

### 6. GOLD

While gold doesn’t always protect against rising inflation in
the short term, it tends to keep up over the long term
(meaning decades).

### 7. COMMODITIES

raw materials prices like oil, metals, and agricultural
products usually increase along with inflation, so they can
be a good hedge against it.

### 8. CRYPTOCURRENCY

Bitcoin is often described as ‘digital gold’ and
theoretically should protect against inflation
because of limited supply
