- `pd.columns`
- **features**: columns sent into our model (and later used to make predictions)
- The steps to building and using a model:
  - define
  - fit
  - predict
  - evaluate
- We can use a for-loop to compare the accuracy of models built with different values for max_leaf_nodes.
- As mentioned above, some of the features will throw an error if you try to use them to train your model
- https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexisbcook/missing-values deal with missing values - As is common, imputing missing values (in Approach 2 and Approach 3) yielded better results, relative to when we simply dropped columns with missing values (in Approach 1).

- supervised learning - regression problem: predict continuous(concrete) valued output - classification problem: predict discrete valued output

- Supervised Learning - In supervised learning, we are given a data set and already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output. - Supervised learning problems are categorized into "regression" and "classification" problems. - In a **regression** problem, we are trying to predict results within a **continuous** output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function. - In a **classification** problem, we are instead trying to predict results in a **discrete** output. In other words, we are trying to map input variables into discrete categories.
- Squaring a feature, in other words, gave the linear model the ability to fit squared features.

- In order to create our training data, there is first some things we must do to our data. Here is the list:

  Create a vocabulary of all of the words used in the patterns (recall the patterns are the queries posed by the user)
  Create a list of the classes â€” This is simply the tags of each intent
  Create a list of all the patterns within the intents file
  Create a list of all the associated tags to go with each pattern in the intents file
