# tell me about your self

first of all, thank you very much for allowing me to be interviewed for your company today
my name is Jason, I'm a student of MingChuan university currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Finance. Although I have chosen Finance as my major. I later found that computer science or working as a software engineer would be the career I will truly be passionate about. Therefore I'm seeking this internship as an opportunity for me to advance in this career. In the past have learned many computer science subjects whenever I have time. I learn programming when I have time. I have learned the skills and done myself many projects that I think that would help me be able to perform this job well and be a good fit for your company. I'm very willing to share them with you today.
