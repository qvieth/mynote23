Thanks to the talk by Julian, i now learn so many valueable lesson from his experience. They are about the opportunity, ecom technical aspects, and how to build future skills set.

I always want to be an entrepreneur. Studying ecommerce will definitely help me to achieve this goal in the future. The experience of Julian working in a location independent job has help me to realize the new job opportunities despite the harsh working environment of Taiwan for foreigners.
Joining college has been the most enthusiastic experience in my life. I got to have the freedom I was yearning for and also made new friends. My parents were not always keeping tabs on me like they did while in high school. I attended most parties I was longing for as well as went for tours and road trips. I spent most of my time with the new friends I made, Charlotte and Krystal. We did almost everything together, like going for parties, road trips, games competitions, etc. However, little did I know what was awaiting me.

Also, working in ecom field as an entrepreneur there are so many challenge for me to overcome. Like the technical details about UX/UI experience or how to do marketing by myself. For instance, the customer trust is a really important detail to pay attention to. The website and learning source for achieving that goal from Julian was really helpful also. I'm taking a look into Amazon Kindle ebook business and shopify thanks to Julian.

The skillset i will focus will be conversion rate optimization for ecom business among the skills suggested by Julian. As this is the main income for generating revenue from the website, I think it will be the most important skill for me to be successful in my future entrepreneurship. 

Pondering and thinking about the future of my entrepreneurship, i feel hopeful as i have learned an valueable experience of Julian. I have created the new roadmap for me to achieve my goal.
