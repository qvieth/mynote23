- [HOW TO ANALYZE BUSINESS CASES](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxyQKUzvuhA)

# - IDENTIFY THE TYPE OF CASE IT IS

- problem
- decision
- evaluation

# - HOW TO APPROACH THE CASE

1. describe the situation
2. develop hypothesis: propose the causes behind the situation
3. proof and action: extract and analyze data in the case
4. identify recommended action: which option is best

# - DECISION-DRIVEN CASE - STEPS:

- describe the situation:
  1. identify the decision options
  2. evaluate strength of options
  3. identify what's at stake - risk
  4. list decision criteria including any explicitly discussed in the case
  5. identify the most important criteria
- develop hypothesis:
  1. select the strongest decision criteria and apply them to the options
  2. identify strengths and weaknesses of criteria for each option
  3. investigate the strongest option based on your confidence in it
  4. consider the option from the view point various constituents
  5. consider the protagonist's position in making the decision
- proof and action:
  1. gather evidence about your hypothesis **from throughout** your case
  2. assess the hypothesis using the evidence, quantitative whenever possible
  3. identify actions that maybe called for your given analysis
  4. create a clear **statement of action** to address the situation - state what will be done and when
- evaluate alternatives:
  1. identify the biggest downside to the option you recommended
  2. state how you would adress the risks/downside outcomes
  3. identify the strongest evidence against the option
  4. find support and make a case for the major alternative option

# - WRITE AND DISCUSS - STEPS:

- state the conclusion first
  1. state the decision to be taken in one sentence(we recommend that they do ...)
  2. briefly state the critical few reasons that will be supported with data(the decision should be taken because...)
- make the case
  1. present the full set of **decision options** that were considered
  2. **list decision criteria** for evaluating options and define how each is measured
  3. **apply the decision criteria** to the **recommended option** and support each with evidence
  4. apply the decision criteria to the **rejected options** and support each with evidence
  5. state any **disadvantages** of choosing the recommended option
- action plan
  1. state **what should be done** in the short, medium, and long-term
  2. list any **potential risks and appropriate responses** in the future given the statement
