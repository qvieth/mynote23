- Best piece of advice my therapist gave me as a young anxious man.
  - Stop concentrating on how your feeling/thinking and pay attention to what the person is actually saying and THEIR body language.
  - Takes a bit of practice but it pulls you out of your head and allows you to start being more relaxed, authentic and socially confident.
  - You'll start noticing other people's little signals and it'll help connect you to them much quicker.
