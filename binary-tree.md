- binary tree is tree which has exactly 1 root, node has at most 2 children, exactly 1 path between root and any node
- root(no that has no parents), leaf(node with 0 children), parent, child, node edges,
- traversal -> depth/breadth
- tree include
- tree sum

- time O(n) due to O(n) elements
- space O(n) due to call stack
