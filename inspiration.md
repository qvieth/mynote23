  - Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.
  - Because almost everything — all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure — these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.

  - You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.
