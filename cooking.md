## fleeting notes

- To achieve a simmer, first bring water to the boiling point and then lower the temperature.
- make pan hot(pan had pore structure, the pore get larger and grip the food more) then add oil -> oil start to shimmer or ripple -> add food
- Food sticks to the pan less if you add the oil to a hot pan
- should you wash meat before cooking or freezing
- food safety

- 4 component of good cooking: salt, fat, acid and heat
  - flavor lies at the intersection of **taste aroma and sensory elements** (sound, appearance, temperature)
  * osmosis & diffusion
  * fat are slow to cool or heat -> add more room temperature oil to cool down, don't have to relex fast
  * use all of your sense to check for doness
  * think about salt, fat, acid, and heat everytime you set out to cook
    - choose the right type of heat for particular foods you're cooking
    - taste and adjust salt, fat, and acid as you go
