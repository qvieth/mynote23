Dear Troy

So Danny told me to send you my study schedule and I see that the schedule it has some time conflict with the job. It caused me to reconsider my suitability for working for you as well. I realized not only this schedule but also myself has a lot conflict with my position. I caused you so much trouble as well.

So please accept this message as a notice of me resigning from the job, also my appology for the trouble I caused at the time. I have told Danny about this situation and he promise will find you a much suitable employee. If you still need me to work for you until Danny fill the position with new employee, I'm still ready for it.

I appreciate the opportunities and lessons you have given while I'm working here.

I wish you the best going forward.

Best regards.

Jason
