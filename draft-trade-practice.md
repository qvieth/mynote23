- [start] This chart shows the revealed comparative advantages (RCA) for Australia by grouping Australia's trade into three key sectors:
    - Primary goods - ores, energy and agriculture.
    - Manufactured goods - other goods.
    - Services: all services (processing excluded).
- In this case, the chart shows, not surprisingly, Australia continue to have a comparative advantage in Primary Goods; even though **services** are the dominant element in Australia's domestic economy, it is still not a comparative strength in its external trade.

- [next] From the graph, we can obviously notice that China is become the biggest business associate with Australia whether in export or import aspect. 

## 5. International logistics infrastructure: Transportation, communication, etc..
- [next]
- freight systems are the lifeblood of Australia's economy 
- Each year its infrastructure operators, transport companies and logistics experts deliver about 4 billion tonnes of goods across Australia – that is 163 tonnes of freight for every person for its entire population. Melbourne alone requires approximately 15,000 tonnes of food to be delivered every day
- this figure shows Australia’s domestic freight task by mode, with thicker arrows indicating greater volumes of freight.
- It shows that bauxite (from Weipa to Gladstone) makes up the highest volume moved by coastal shipping
- while iron ore and coal make up the highest volume task moved by rail
- Iron ore and coal move across privately operated rail networks in the Pilbara, Central Queensland and Hunter Valley.
- These networks are usually simpler to operate than multiuser networks, being largely single use, and already near, if not at, world’s best practice.
