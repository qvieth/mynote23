1. Define the dimensions of performance based on your job analysis.
2. Develop descriptions of effective and ineffective behavior on these dimensions (by, for example, using **critical incidents** obtained from workers and supervisors).
3. Have subject matter experts (SMEâ€™s) sort the behaviors into dimensions and rate them on a continuum of effectiveness. Select a subset to represent performance levels.
4. Develop valid & reliable measurements for your performance levels.
