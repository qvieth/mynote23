workaholism:bad - work engagement:good -> X
-> motivational correlates of X + burnout

- structural equation modeling: `+|> positive correlate -|> negative correlate`

  - workaholism +|> introjected regulation && identified regulation
  - work enggagement +|> intrinsic regulation
  - burnout -|> intrinsic regulation
  - different motivational regulation |> different job-related well-being

- [self determination theory](self-determination-theory)

  - concern with the motivation beind choices
  - without external influence and interference
  - focuses on the degree to which human behavior is self-motivated and self-determined

- job-related well-being:

  - workaholism: state of mind that is uncontrollable inner drive to work hard
  - work enggagement: positive, fulfilling, work-related state of mind, engaged employees have by passion for their work
  - burnout: state of exhaustion in which workers are cynical about the value of their occupation and doubtful of their capacity to perform
    -> outcomes for employees, their spouses, and their companies

- In contrast to workaholic and engaged employees, employees experiencing burnout are not pushed or pulled to work. Rather, they have developed a mental distance towards their work.

# - SDT

social environment either support or thwart individual's growth tendency
behavioral regulation:

- autonomous vs relatively autonomous vs controlled

- varied form of extrinsic motivation
  - external
  - introjected
  - identified
  - integrated
- book p.16 they can be motivated by intrinsic and by varied types of extrinsic motivations
- wiki: A taxonomy of motivations have been described based on the degree to which they are internalized.
  - Internalization refers to the active attempt to transform an extrinsic motive into personally endorsed values and thus assimilate behavioral regulations that were originally external
- three basic psychological needs that must be satisfied to foster well-being and health: <- learn these by heart wiki
  - autonomy
  - competence
  - relatedness
- Basic needs theory (BNT): considers three psychological needs that are related to intrinsic motivation
- need for competence and autonomy is the basis of intrinsic motivation and behaviour. This is a link between people's basic needs and their motivations

- extrinsic
  - external regulation: least autonomous/ most controlled
  - introjected regulation: its regulation is introjected
  - identified regulation
  - intergrated regulation: most autonomous extrinsic motivation - goals that are trying to be achieved are for reasons extrinsic to the self, - rather than the inherent enjoyment or interest in the task.
- instrinsic motivation

  - needs of competence and autonomy

- intrinsic - self-determination - psychological needs fulfilled
- Self-Determination Theory (SDT) represents a broad framework for the study of human motivation and personality
- SDT proposes that the degree to which any of these three psychological needs is unsupported or thwarted within a social context will have a robust detrimental impact on wellness in that setting.
- SDT is an organismic dialectical approach. It begins with the assumption that people are active organisms, with evolved tendencies toward growing, mastering ambient challenges, and integrating new experiences into a coherent sense of self. These natural developmental tendencies do not, however, operate automatically, but instead require ongoing social nutriments and supports. That is, the social context can either support or thwart the natural tendencies toward active engagement and psychological growth, or it can catalyze lack of integration, defense, and fulfillment of need-substitutes. Thus, it is the dialectic between the active organism and the social context that is the basis for SDT’s predictions about behavior, experience, and development
- Within SDT, the nutriments for healthy development and functioning are specified using the concept of basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness.
- To the extent that the needs are ongoingly satisfied, people will develop and function effectively and experience wellness, but to the extent that they are thwarted, people will more likely evidence ill-being and non-optimal functioning. The darker sides of human behavior and experience, such as certain types of psychopathology, prejudice, and aggression are understood in terms of reactions to basic needs having been thwarted, either developmentally or proximally

- denial state, bargaining... where does this come from -> acceptance

- producitivity
- we glamourize workaholic because there is assumption that work = success then people who dedicate their life to work must be successful, or at least has the potential to be
- intense work culture
- there are people working harder than CEO of billion dollar company but they are... barely surviving, it's not simple as work harder, there's factors affecting these people
- The scary thing is that this really all starts when you are a kid/teen
- We do so many hours of homework in high school with so many extracurriculars so that we can even GET IN to college,
- never mind the jobs a lot of us have to work in order to pay for it.
- As a High School student, getting 5-6 hours of sleep is the norm, and if you get 7 or up, you are considered lucky.
- It’s so screwed up

- resource is limited,
- secure
- competing

  1. feeling compeled to work because of internal pressure
  2. persistent thought about work when not working
  3. working beyond what is reasonably expected, despite the potential for negative consequences

## method - nurse and physician

## discussion

- this study examines the correlation of **different types of motivation** defined in SDT and **job-related well-being**

### 4 interesting findings:

1. workaholism +> extrinsic motivation , workaholism +> identified regulation
2. work engagement +> intrinsic motivation
3. work engagement +> extrinsic motivation
4. burnout -> intrinsic motivation and autonomous extrinsic motivation, burnout +> introjected regulation for physician group only(not the nurse)

=> suggestion from author:
One explanation for the finding that only among physician group we find positive correlation between burnout and introject regulation is that:

- As physician vow to the Hippocratic Oath, is that physicians have a strong and internalised ethic of responsibility: they feel they must work (Wu, Zhu, Li, Wang, & Wang, 2008)
- As a result, physicians may feel they must work (i.e. work is a duty), whereas not working may induce negative feelings about oneself.
  => These findings support earlier findings that **need satisfaction** -> **emotional exhaustion**

Whereas burned-out physicians are primarily driven by introjected regulation, burned-out nurses are not driven by any of the motivational regulations in particular.
=> These findings contradict the assumption that burned-out employees’ behavior is motivated by both external and introjected regulation. Rather these findings suggest that nurses experiencing burnout are a-motivated.

- This strong internalised work ethic may encourage the development of burnout, which could explain why physicians are among the occupational groups with the highest levels of burnout (Schaufeli, 2007).
  => These findings support earlier findings that **need satisfaction** -> **emotional exhaustion**
- Whereas burned-out physicians are primarily driven by introjected regulation, burned-out nurses are not driven by any of the motivational regulations in particular
- These findings contradict the assumption that burned-out employees’ behavior is motivated by both external and introjected regulation
- rather the findings suggests that nurses experiencing burnout are amotivated.

```
point out amotivation from SDT: Amotivation manifests itself by acting without intent or refraining from any acting.
It is the consequence of not valuing an activity, not feeling competent to perform it, or not believing that it will lead to a desired outcome (Ryan & Deci, 2000a).
It seems plausible that burned-out employees are a-motivated because they distance themselves from their work to prevent further depletion of mental resources

## limitation

- One limitation of the present study is that all constructs were measured using self-reports
- Second, our data were collected among a relatively homogeneous sample of Chinese medical professionals
- Third, the present study used a cross-sectional design. the design did not allow the authors to examine the causal relations among these concepts

## theoretical and practical implications

The present study provide both theoretical and practical implications, also extends previous research in at least three ways.

### - theoretical implications:

1. First, theoretical implication: it is the first to uncover the motivational correlates of workaholism, work engagement, and burnout using SDT and to show that these correlates differ substantially and meaningfully.

   - Although workaholic employees are basically extrinsically motivated, engaged employees are both extrinsically and intrinsically motivated.

2. Second, the present study provides indirect evidence for SDT's assumption

   - that human beings are active, growth-oriented organisms and that fostering this tendency leads to optimal functioning and well-being, whereas thwarting it leads to adverse outcomes.

### - practical impliications:

3. Third, the present study provides directions for practical use. Since work engagement is linked to beneficial outcomes at the individual and organisational levels

   - The present study suggests that fostering autonomous motivation may simultaneously lead to an increase in work engagement and a decrease in workaholism and burnout.
   - One way to achieve this is by making jobs more attractive and challenging to employees, and adopting an autonomy-supportive management style that includes being emphatic, offering choices, and providing meaningful rationales for doing particular tasks

## conclusion comments

examined the **motivational correlates** of workaholism, work engagement, and burnout

Workaholic employees work hard because they are mainly driven or pushed by a strong need to prove themselves and because they personally value work outcomes,

while engaged employees work hard because they are mainly pulled by their inherently enjoyable and satisfying work.

Finally, employees experiencing burnout are neither pushed nor pulled to work; rather, they distance themselves from their work.

Although the associations among motivational regulation and job-related well-being are more complex than was anticipated, -> state out the anticipated
the present study demonstrated that workaholism, work engagement, and burnout are each associated with a prototypical underlying motivational regulation.

# suggestion from me

- the study only suggest work engagement **relate**, the cross-sectional study did not allow authors to examine the causation of these variables
- using longitudinal -> change the design, what cause engagement vs workaholism
- work engagement: a state of happy -> more productive
  - what if more productive -> work engeagement
- workaholic -> conflict, not satify
  - what if not satisfy with salary, conflict with worker -> workaholism
  - more work home inference -> workaholism
- a bad day -> it gonna worse -> find research for this

- burnout and amotivation: what is amotivation according to SDT

**basic psychological needs** that may be either satisfied or frustrated,
SDT revolve around the proposition that processes of active development and organization require specific nutrients from the social environment.
set of basic psychological needs that may be either satisfied or frustrated
Need-­supportive environment facilitate the development of integrated self-­regulatn
, including capaties to manage the multiple drives, impulses, emotions, and motives that arise within
every individual (e.g., Bindman, et al. 2015; Di Domenico et al., 2013). If basic needs are thwarted,
there is alternatively fragmentation and defense rather than integration
internalization or integration: assimilate social norms and regulations
