- definition of **labor force**
    - labor force refers to all the people willing and able to work
    - for an organizattion, the labor force consists of
        - internal labor force
            - an organization.... `check the powerpoint`

    - value unexpected rewards
    - values opportunities for learning
    - values time when planning management
- millenials
    -

    - the most ethnically diverse generation, tolerance of differnce

- HR implications of an aging workforce
    - HRM spends much time on retirement planning, retraining and motivating workers.

- **employee empowerment**: giving employees responsibility and authority to make decision regarding all aspects of product development. or customer service
### question 1: what examples of empowerment can you think of college studetn? how do you think this will affect them positively
Before analyzing employee empowerment in terms of student regarded, I defined student empowerment as anything school or professor done in order to best facilitate student to reach their highest potential.

The current context, which i saw in many "critic article about education", is that the traditional way is actually disempowering students: it's too much theorically heavy, lack of critical debate or feedback from student. One of the main reason, i see, is that grading system has no way for openness or creativity. Difference doesn't lead to higher grade, critics from student about current knowledge doesn't lead to higher grade, perhaps the worst situation, in some education, is no open commucation is encourage.

So I suggest a way for combating this problem: allow students to grade themselves, or at least allow peer-to-peer grading.
The biggest problems hindering this vision to cometrue is personal honesty which has something to do with morality. But the future is bright, perhaps the advance of technologies, internet of things, AI, would be a potential for us to solve this problem. IOT has application of dealing with realtime data, AI can detect anomaly, cheating,... That's my suggestion!

### question 2: why do you think employers may be reluctant to practice empowerment?
technological barriers i think, also maybe the cost is too high.
