# The books that shape my 2021

Like myself overconfident in my cooking skill, i also overconfident about the book i read. I love giving book recommendation as I belive that for every book one read it has help them to grow up a little bit or even by miles.

> a reader live a thousand lives before he dies

So I did want to changed my friends around me: by giving them the text message "hey you read this awesome book"(even when i started reading that book for just the first 10 pages), and i even tried to create a blog to give book recommendation, or summary/review.

Despite my enthusiasm, my recommendation couldn't make my friend excited enough reading the book. Also, when they give me back theirs, I wasn't excited the way they feel. As time progress, i restrained myself. I realized what i enjoy reading and what others enjoy reading was diffferent based on our experience, the problem we are facing, our expectation when reading that book.

That being so, i don't want this list to be a list of book recommendation, but a self relfection on what i read. These are the book that shape the way i think, grow me up and help me answer the questions i didn't have the answer at the time.

# what book I read and how i consider a book good

- how-to books vs what-and-why books
- I always do research whether i should read a book or not, sometimes their summary if i'm in doubt if there are pretty much i can get away from that book.

  - I start with a problem that i want to solve and then look for which book relating that problem is good to read.
  - Also, i choose to read books which has its reputation proven by time, or recommended by people i admire, for example Elon musk.

- For me, a book is good if it do one of the following things:

  - it solve my problems
  - it impress me with the ideas that stick
  - it allow you to travel in time, space or people's mind
  - it let you know the author

- Based on these principles, if you think there are books that will shape me the same way it shape you, please feel free to recommend me some.

# The books that changed the way I see the world and my place in it

for now i cannot do review like this must reread each book a more sophisticated review

## Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor E. Frankl

“Love is the only way to grasp another human being in the innermost core of his personality. No one can become fully aware of the very essence of another human being unless he loves him. By his love he is enabled to see the essential traits and features in the beloved person; and even more, he sees that which is potential in him, which is not yet actualized but yet ought to be actualized. Furthermore, by his love, the loving person enables the beloved person to actualize these potentialities. By making him aware of what he can be and of what he should become, he makes these potentialities come true.”

## Gendered Lives by Julia T. Wood, Natalie Fixmer-Oraiz

i my list i would recommend many text book and this is one of them. before reading this book, i didn't have a view of how men and women are different, i simply think if they are different it is because the human minds this person are different from that person not this gender are different from that gender. But this book just reeducate me on the idea. i also have another look at gender, gender is not same as sex, also it is shaped by the culture, biology traits of the body and the brain, for many people this is obvious but for me this book really show me a new perspective about human life.
