  - The declarative approach is more readable

    - The details of how each of these functions
      - is implemented are abstracted away
    - declarative programming produces applications that are easier to reason about, and when it’s easier to reason about an application, that application is easier to scale.
    - **these functions make our code less imperative**

- research
  - have big question then **narrow it down by doing literature review-**

research question: do different goal setting leads to/correlate with different work job related well-being(workaholism, work engagement and burnout)

- cIV: differnt kinds of setting goals(this need to clarified by reading some literature review to see if some one has define it)
- cDV: workaholism, work engagement, burnout

literature review part will include:

- Workaholism, work engagement, and burnout are three different kinds of
  job-related well-being (Schaufeli et al., 2008)
- Three major contributors to the study of goals and motivation from the field of social cognition are introduced and their work summarized. They include: (i) Deci and Ryan's Self-Determination Model; (ii) Emmons' work on goals and personal strivings, and (iii) Karniol and Ross' discussion of temporal influences on goal-setting.
- -> currently i need to read these work to see how goal setting are defined... -> i'm planning to add these works to my literature review

method: i have found that structural equation model would help me to solve this question as it:"measure and analyze the relationships of observed and latent variables", but i'm not sure how to exactly do it yet

- my idea is based on the work by Ilona van Beek\* :"For Fun, Love, or Money: What Drives Workaholic, Engaged, and Burned-Out Employees at Work?", the author research tried to link how differnt kinds of motivation(defined by Ryan and Deci, 4 kinds of motivation ranged from autonomy to controlled spectrum) linked with diffferent kind of job related well-being

- Locke and Latham provide a well-developed goal-setting theory of motivation. The theory emphasizes the important relationship between goals and performance.
- Research supports predictions that the most effective performance seems to result when goals are specific and challenging, when they are used to evaluate performance and linked to feedback on results, and create commitment and acceptance

## fleeting notes

- https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary?page=radicals

## principles

- snapshot system(chronological-based) vs categorize system(relevant-based) : i'm testing the new way to organize knowledge

1. ask what to learn and can it be practiced daily
2. book review: write subjective reactions, not objective truths
3. name it to tame it
   - constantly ask: what is this emotion -> what tone of voice? -> what facial expression?
   - emotion tells us what to pay attention to
   - Emotions are often confused with feelings and moods, but the three terms are not interchangeable.
4. [Basic Economics](Basic-Economics)
5. clear thinking becomes clear writing... it's impossible for a muddy thinker to write good english.
6. communication : kill vs kiss
7. decision making framework :
   1. solve a problems, topics?
   2. -> google top 10 books of ...
   3. -> summary of the book
   4. -> pick the good book to read
   5. how to get quick insight, read summary, review, take their insights

9. [emotional intelligence](emotional-intelligence)
10. your actions have consequences
11. [who coined the term introvert](https://www.simplypsychology.org/introvert-extrovert.html) : 3/1 ratios of extro/intro <- this is bullshit
12. [emotion in psychology terms](https://online.uwa.edu/news/emotional-psychology/)
    - Emotions are often confused with feelings and moods, but the three terms are not interchangeable
      - A feeling is the result of an emotion and may be influenced by memories, beliefs and other factors.
      - A mood is described by the APA as “any short-lived emotional state, usually of low intensity.” Moods differ from emotions because they lack stimuli and have no clear starting point
      - Defining emotions is a task that is not yet complete. Many researchers are still proposing theories about what makes up our emotions, and existing theories are constantly being challenged.
      - Still, there’s a good basis of knowledge to analyze when exploring the topic.
    - American Psychological Association(APA) defined emotion as a reaction pattern involving:
      - subjective experience: aka stimulus
      - and physiological response: reaction, result of autonomic nervous system
      - behavioral response: result of the emotional process
    - our ability to understand others’ behavioral responses plays a huge role in our emotional intelligence, which will be discussed in more detail later.
    - https://www.verywellmind.com/what-are-emotions-2795178
    - That is why it’s important that we’re able to understand emotions as they play such an important role in how we behave.
    - Emotional intelligence is the ability to perceive, control and evaluate emotions
    - The term was first coined by researchers Peter Salovey and John D. Mayer and found popularity through Dan Goleman’s 1996 book
    - Emotions motivate people to respond quickly to stimuli in the environment, which helps improve the chances of success and survival.
