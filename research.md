# UDEMY A-Z guide to writing a rockstar Research Paper with a bulletproof Research Methodology!

Research method for business students

## Section 1: module 1 - starting with research

### 2. What is research:

1. your research must bring in something new
2. you will have to stick to these methodological guidelines

### 3. Basic vs Applied research

- continuum from basic to applied:
  - basic research:
    - intention: to expand general knowledge of processes
    - result: universal principles
  - applied research
    - to improve the understanding of particular problem
    - solution to a particular problem

basic research is usually done at the universities, while applied research is usually done in companies and organizations

### 4. Exploratory, descriptive and explanatory nature

- exploratory: -> explore

  - the initial research into a hypothetical or theoretical idea:
    - taking well-defined theories and applying them in your area
    - developing your own theories from scratch
  - if you are in university, most of the research will be exploratory

- descriptive: -> describe

  - attempts to explore and explain while providing additional information about the topic
  - you need to gather a lot of data for descriptive research

- explanatory: -> explain
  - try to explain relationships between variables
  - build on both exploratory and descriptive research

question type:

1. exploratory: what(what is happening in there)
2. descriptive: how(how do these things work together)
3. explanatory: why

### 5. Choosing a research topic and idea

1. choose topic that your are **passionate** about
2. choose topic that can be valuable for you when you have a degree
3. the research should be a conjoin between 2 fields: one field is what you are studying(business), the other field gonna be your passion(technology)

### 6. Introduction and Rationale of your research

Ratinale as a part of introduction(goes from most general -> less general -> concrete -> rationale):

- it simply a justification or a brief explanation of why your research worth the investment or worth the time reading

### 7. Problem desciption

- "more detail" justification of your research
- 2-4 pages long
- identifies important aspects in a problem that your research is attempting to address

example:

- this sentence is too vague :"many Saas start-ups fail in their early years of existence"
- specific: -> 60-90% of Saas startups **fail**(still fail is not clear) withtin first 2 years of existence
- more specific -> - 60-90% of Saas startups are unable to achive scalable and repeatable sales withtin first 2 years of existence

### 8. Writing research question and objectives

- **there are no universal recipe of how to write the research properly**
- research aim: where are you heading with your research
