# research design

a plan for answering a research question using emperical data:

1. your overall aims and approach
2. the type of design you'll use
3. how you'll select participants
4. your data collection methods
5. the procedure you'll follow
6. your data analysis strategies

## step 2: the type of design you'll use

### quantitative -> deal with number and statistics

- 2 types:
  1. descriptive and correlational:
  - descriptive design -> focuses on systematically measuring variables
  - correlation design -> test whether variables are related to each other
  2. experimental & quasi-experimental

### qualitative -> deals with words and meanings

case study
ethnography: gathering data about the culture of a group or organization by immersing yourself in the community

### mix-methods -> integrate both quantitative and qualitative

### step 3: participants

what population will you focus on?
how will you select a sample to collect data from

### step 4: data collection methods

### step 5 data collection procedures

- how will you reliably measure your variables
- what step will you take in collecting and managing your data

### step 6: your data analysis strategies

- choosing statistical tests that match your variables
- planning your approach to coding & interpreting the data

  - adapted form merriam & tisdell(2016):
    - quantitative:
      - experimental research: divide people into groups and test which intervention works best on each
      - survey: describe 'what is', and see how variables are diestributed across a phenomenon
      - randomized controlled trials: large-scale tests with blind control groups unknown to research
    - qualitative
      - case study: a close observation and analysis of a small group or bounded situation
      - ethnography: extended period of embedded observation and understanding in a social environment
      - action research: reflective process of engaged, practical exploration of new ways to practice
  - analysis evidence(telling a story)
    - what happened? look through it to see what kind of story it tell
      - qualitative: themes, narratives, ideas
      - quantitaive: effects, patterns, outcomes
