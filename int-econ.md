- 7 themes recur throughout the study of international econ:
  - the gain from trade
  - the patter of trade: who sell what to whom
  - protectionism
  - the balance of payments
  - exchange rate determination
  - international policy coordination
  - international capital market

- moodle:
  - ricardian model
  - specific factors and income distribution
  - resource and trade: the heckscher ohlin  model
  - c15 standard trade model
  - chap16: external economies of scale and the international location of production

- gravity model : T = A * Y * Y / D
  - Y : GDP
  - D: distance
  - A constant
- beside these, there are
  - culture
  - geography
  - multinational corporation
  - the existance of border
    - influence trade
- what do we trade:
  - manufactured goods
  - service
  - mineral
  - agricultural

- over the past 50 years, the export of developing countries have shifted towards manufactures
- national saving - domestic investment = current account (appro= export - import)
- current account = country's net foreign investment

here is the my calculating steps given the marketcap of 2015 and percentage of change from adjusted price

1. Take the market capitalization of 2015 as the starting point of the time series.
2. For each subsequent year, multiply the market capitalization of the previous year by the percentage change in the adjusted price for that year.
3. Repeat step 2 for each year from 2016 to 2022.
4. Summarize the resulting time series in a table or chart.

Example of how I perform the calculation for the market capitalization time series for 2015 to 2022:

Assume that the market capitalization in 2015 was $100 billion, and the percentage change in the adjusted price for each year from 2016 to 2022 is as follows:

2016: 10%
2017: 5%
2018: -2%
2019: 8%
2020: -15%
2021: 20%
2022: 10%

Using these values, we can calculate the market capitalization time series as follows:

2015: $100 billion
2016: $110 billion (10% increase from 2015)
2017: $115.5 billion (5% increase from 2016)
2018: $113.19 billion (-2% decrease from 2017)
2019: $122.30 billion (8% increase from 2018)
2020: $103.95 billion (-15% decrease from 2019)
2021: $124.74 billion (20% increase from 2020)
2022: $137.21 billion (10% increase from 2021)
