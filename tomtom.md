# 7 ways location tech changing industry
[7 ways location tech changing industry](https://www.orange-business.com/en/blogs/where-world-7-ways-location-technology-changing-industries)
location: indoor and outdoor
- These systems rely on three main backbones: gis, ips, iot(provide data to gis and ips)
- these work with a variety of other technologies: mobile conectivity, WANs, PANs, GPS

- Mobile networks
  - LoRa
  - and Bluetooth LE;
  - 4G (soon 5G);
  - and a range of indoor and outdoor IoT solutions mean everything,
  - from you and your children to the HVAC system in your warehouse,
  - is connected.
- This makes it possible for enterprise users to
  - reach customers where they are
  - protect employees in the field
  - monitor systems for fraud 
  - and even manage public transport and heavy infrastructure.
- Like so many solutions in this age of digital change, these tools pose a price. 
  - connected devices will depend on geodata by 2020.
- Location tech
  1. in retail
  2. marketing
  3. outdoor maps, tracking
    - use in agriculture
    - award-winning project under the sobloo umbrella, TeleCense
    - uses Copernicus Sentinel satellite images
    - to deliver accurate geo-localized population estimates
    - and demographic trends on a local or regional basis
  4. indoor maps
    - catalogs of indoor maps that enable to navigate airports, train station and shopping malls
    - smart home devices, vacuum cleaner
  5. crime and fraud prevention
  6. health
  7. logistics and distribution
    - Air transport technology specialist SITA claims
      - 24 million items of baggage are lost in transit each year
    - Location-aware RFID tags can help find them
    - Innovative ride and car sharing schemes also use
      - tracking devices
      - and RFID
        - to assess billing time.

- Emerging technologies improving accuracy
  - 5G networks
  - Ultra Wideband (UWB)
  - WiFi 6
  - augmented and virtual reality
  - machine intelligence systems 
  - even voice assistants like Apple’s Siri
  - and advanced LiDAR imaging solutions 
    - mean the implementations (in both real and digital space) of such technologies become more profound

    * Apple’s recent adoption of UWB is a case in point.
      - Today, most radio frequency (RF) solutions for indoor tracking make use of
        - Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons and tags
      - but UWB may unlock more possibility.
        - It’s a **low-power** wireless technology
        - that transmits data across a wide bandwidth (from 500 MHz up to several gigahertz)
      - with little interference and multiple advantages
        - that make it useful in certain scenarios:
          - It transmits data at 8 megabits per second, four times faster than Bluetooth
          - It can transfer data up to 10 meters
          - The signal passes through walls more reliably than Bluetooth or Wi-Fi
          - Location data is accurate to up to 10 centimeters (Bluetooth is 1 meter)
          - The signal is more secure and directionally aware, so it’s harder to hack 
        - The PAN technology works best with mobile, and emerging mobile solutions mean that local location awareness can be used at scale – great for IoT deployments.
        - Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) wireless,
          - such as LoRa, enables highly-secure, low-bandwidth, low-power implementations to connect deeply-isolated yet essential industrial systems – air quality monitors
          - for example. Such LPWA networks are expected to become a $23 billion industry in 2020.
# All there is to know about location technology the ultimate guide
https://www.incognia.com/the-authentication-reference/all-there-is-to-know-about-location-technology-the-ultimate-guide

- covid: bluetooth location
- RFID
- Fixed location BLE beacons(geobeacons)

- what is the difference between location technology and location-enabled services?
- IP addressesGPS

1. GPS
2. Nearby wireless access points
3. IP addresses
4. Cellular towers
5. MAC (media access control) addresses
6. Wireless routers
- A location-aware application is an app that uses the location provided by the user, with their consent, after they opted-in, to deliver a service, information, or perform a specific task.
- The user location can vary from very precise to approximate. 
- Also, the application needs to be explicit on why the user's location is necessary and how it is going to be used before the operating system allows it to run.

- What is the main purpose of location-based applications?
  - Live Traffic, navigation, and public transportation apps
  - Travel and check-in apps for travelers 
  - Social and dating apps 
  - Food delivery and restaurants

- Is there a way to fool location technology? What is location spoofing?
  - fake location: vpn, proxies, emulators
- geo blocking
-  GPS spoofing technology can easily evade fraud detection systems that
  - rely solely on GPS or IP addresses.
    - Businesses that do not count on more robust technology,
      - are very exposed to this type of threat
