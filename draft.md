workaholism:bad - work engagement:good -> X
-> motivational correlates of X + burnout

- structural equation modeling: `+|> positive correlate -|> negative correlate`

  - workaholism +|> introjected regulation && identified regulation
  - work enggagement +|> intrinsic regulation
  - burnout -|> intrinsic regulation
  - different motivational regulation |> different job-related well-being

- [self determination theory](self-determination-theory)

  - concern with the motivation beind choices
  - without external influence and interference
  - focuses on the degree to which human behavior is self-motivated and self-determined

- job-related well-being:

  - workaholism: state of mind that is uncontrollable inner drive to work hard
  - work enggagement: positive, fulfilling, work-related state of mind, engaged employees have by passion for their work
  - burnout: state of exhaustion in which workers are cynical about the value of their occupation and doubtful of their capacity to perform
    -> outcomes for employees, their spouses, and their companies

- In contrast to workaholic and engaged employees, employees experiencing burnout are not pushed or pulled to work. Rather, they have developed a mental distance towards their work.

# - SDT

social environment either support or thwart individual's growth tendency
behavioral regulation:

- autonomous vs relatively autonomous vs controlled

- varied form of extrinsic motivation
  - external
  - introjected
  - identified
  - integrated
- book p.16 they can be motivated by intrinsic and by varied types of extrinsic motivations
- wiki: A taxonomy of motivations have been described based on the degree to which they are internalized.
  - Internalization refers to the active attempt to transform an extrinsic motive into personally endorsed values and thus assimilate behavioral regulations that were originally external
- three basic psychological needs that must be satisfied to foster well-being and health: <- learn these by heart wiki
  - autonomy
  - competence
  - relatedness
- Basic needs theory (BNT): considers three psychological needs that are related to intrinsic motivation
- need for competence and autonomy is the basis of intrinsic motivation and behaviour. This is a link between people's basic needs and their motivations

- extrinsic
  - external regulation: least autonomous/ most controlled
  - introjected regulation: its regulation is introjected
  - identified regulation
  - intergrated regulation: most autonomous extrinsic motivation - goals that are trying to be achieved are for reasons extrinsic to the self, - rather than the inherent enjoyment or interest in the task.
- instrinsic motivation
  - needs of competence and autonomy

- intrinsic - self-determination - psychological needs fulfilled
- Self-Determination Theory (SDT) represents a broad framework for the study of human motivation and personality
- SDT proposes that the degree to which any of these three psychological needs is unsupported or thwarted within a social context will have a robust detrimental impact on wellness in that setting.
- SDT is an organismic dialectical approach. It begins with the assumption that people are active organisms, with evolved tendencies toward growing, mastering ambient challenges, and integrating new experiences into a coherent sense of self. These natural developmental tendencies do not, however, operate automatically, but instead require ongoing social nutriments and supports. That is, the social context can either support or thwart the natural tendencies toward active engagement and psychological growth, or it can catalyze lack of integration, defense, and fulfillment of need-substitutes. Thus, it is the dialectic between the active organism and the social context that is the basis for SDTâ€™s predictions about behavior, experience, and development
- Within SDT, the nutriments for healthy development and functioning are specified using the concept of basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness.
- To the extent that the needs are ongoingly satisfied, people will develop and function effectively and experience wellness, but to the extent that they are thwarted, people will more likely evidence ill-being and non-optimal functioning. The darker sides of human behavior and experience, such as certain types of psychopathology, prejudice, and aggression are understood in terms of reactions to basic needs having been thwarted, either developmentally or proximally
