- What we call marketing communication (marcom for short) involves the use of a variety
  - tools and **functions** such as
    - **advertising**
    - **public relations**
    - sales promotion
    - direct response
    - events and sponsorships
    - point of sale
    - digital media
    - and the communication aspects of packaging
    - as well as personal sales
    - and new forms of online communication that are constantly being developed.
  - The management challenge, then, is to plan and monitor all the messages delivered by all the various types of marketing communication so that they work together to present the brand in a coherent and consistent way as a coordinated basket of messages.

### - the marketing mix aka 4ps:

- 4ps all deliver messages about the brand
- products: Their design and performance say about the brand
- place (where it’s available, distribution), what does the store and online store contribute to the **brand image**

- promotion
  - what does the **formal marketing communication** messages (such as
    - advertising
    - public relations
    - direct communication
    - events and sponsorships
    - packaging
    - sales promotion
    - and other planned messages)
  - say about the brand?

### - How Does the Marketing Mix Send Messages?

- Key elements of a product’s success:
  - Design
  - performance
  - and quality
- product:
- When a product performs well, its
  - performance sends a positive **message** that this brand is
  - **okay to repurchase or revisit**. (The opposite is also true: poor
  - performance sends a negative message.) A positive brand
  - experience also motivates the buyer to recommend the brand to
  - others, extending the reach of the positive experience through
  - word of mouth.
- price: based not only on:
  - cost of making
  - marketing
  - expected margin of profit
  - effect of price on brand image
- consumer’s ability to gauge the product's value: price/value proposition
- **Psychological pricing strategies**
  - use marketing communication to affect the customer’s judgment of value.
  - For example, ads showing prestige pricing in which a high price seems to make the product worthy or
    - valuable may be illustrated by photographs of the “exceptional product” in luxury settings
    - or by ad copy explaining the reasons for a high price.
    - The meaning of the price is often dependent on the context provided by the marketing communication, which puts the price in perspective.
- **Promotional pricing**
  - is used to communicate a dramatic or temporary price reduction through terms such as sale, special, and today only.
- distribution strategy: intermidiary, push(incentive to intermediaries) or pull(customer demand)
- added value: to think about added value: think of 2 chai tra xanh 1 chai k nhan hieu 1 chai tra xanh 0 do, chai k nhan hieu la original value, chai co brand la added value
