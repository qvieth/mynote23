## gendered communication

women and men communicate differently

- what we think and what we behave are differently
- Gender Differences in Speech Content:
  - research into gendered communication started only about 50 years ago
  - Men tend to a “report” style, meaning they use speech that contains facts, data and aims to solve problems. They tend to leave out personal information or anecdotes. They also tend to try to dominate a conversation
  - communication researchers have only been examining it for about 50 years. Initially, research centered on the differences between men and women’s language styles
  - Building on that, we began to analyze the concepts of dominance and control. Today, most research in this area focuses on identity formation, multiplicities, and similarities. 
  - Gender attitudes are confusing. What does it mean to be masculine? What does it mean to be feminine? What are your attitudes?

https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0093650215590605 Gendered Communication and Career Outcomes:
- Results generally support our hypotheses that masculine communication style is related to hierarchical advancement
  - (e.g., number of promotions, advancement to higher managerial levels),
- whereas feminine communication style is related to non-hierarchical rewards
  - (e.g., higher compensation, increased span of control)
- Unexpectedly, feminine communication style also positively predicts two indicators of hierarchical career success.
- Furthermore, an interaction effect suggests that gendered communication style has more of an impact on women’s compensation than on men’s.

- social pressures that exacerbate gendered communication


evidence : 2 ways from other paper, content analysis

Unlike sex, which is classified based on genetic and biological factors, gender is learned and performed (J. T. Wood, 2013)

While extant research has considered gender as a socially constructed, learned concept, it has largely ignored the performative nature of the gender construct, result-
ing in a rather narrow understanding of the relationship between gender and organizational phenomena (Mumby, 2006).

On one hand, career advancement theory suggests that masculinity tends to predict career success (Fagenson, 1990; Tharenou, 1997b).

These differing theoretical perspectives reflect contrasting alternatives through which to predict career outcomes

Kirchmeyer (2002) finds masculinity to be positively related to promotion rate but not to income

Furthermore, leadership literature suggests that femininity has become more universally desirable (Elsesser & Lever, 2011) and that androgynous individuals (those who possess both high masculine and high feminine characteristics) tend to emerge as organizational leaders (Kent & Moss, 1994)

Gendered Communication and Career Outcomes:

```
A is dependent variable (in our case it's Advancement of positions)
B C D E F G are independent variable

after doing survey we will have A B C D E F 
then we create pairs of dependent and independent variables to see which one leads to change
6 pairs are:  A-B | A-C | A-D | A-E | A-F 

        A ▲                             A ▲                                A ▲                             A ▲                              A ▲

- we gathered and discussed topic, after we choose the topic we do some more preliminary research to find out which problems interested us
