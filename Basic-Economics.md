# Basic Economics

## Chapter 1: What is economics

These basic principles of economics have applied around the world and have applied over thousands of years of recorded history. They apply in many very **different kinds of economies - capitalist, socialist, feudal**, or whatever - and among a wide variety of peoples, cultures, and governments.

To know what economics is, we must know what economy is. The Garden of Eden was a system for production and distribution of goods and services, but it was not economy, because everything was available in unlimited abundance. Without scarcity, there is no need to economize - and therefore no economics.

> Economics is the study of the use(production and distribution) of scarce resources which have alternative uses.
