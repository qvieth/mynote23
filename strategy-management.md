# strategy management

S-C-P: Structure - Conduct - Performance -> focus on environment structure-> external 
RBV: Resource Based View -> focus on resource and capabilities -> internal

logic framework ,tools for developing and analyzing

resources and capabilities:
- capabilities are subset of resources -> assets that enable firm to take advantage of resources
- resources: mobile and immobile resouce -> capabilities are mobile(alive) reouces, its active, connect and control the immobile
- 4 broad categories:
  - financial
  - physical
  - individual
  - organizational


VRIO:
- V: The question of value is: “Do resources and capabilities enable a firm to exploit an external **opportunity** or neutralize an external **threat**?”  -> if yes -> strength, no -> weakness
- only valuable to the extent that they enable a firm to enhance its competitive position
- **resouce and capabilities are nothing valueable except if they enable the firm to gain the advantage competition**


example of applying VRIO:
To examine how the VRIO framework can be applied in analyzing real strategic situations, consider the competitive position of Southwest Airlines. Southwest Airlines has been the only consistently profitable airline in the United States over the past 30 years. While many U.S. airlines have gone in and out of bankruptcy, Southwest has remained profitable. How could it gain this competitive advantage?
Potential sources of this competitive advantage fall into two big categories: operational choices Southwest has made and Southwest’s approach to managing its people. On the operational side, Southwest has chosen to fly only a single type of aircraft (Boeing 737), only flies into smaller airports, has avoided complicated hub-and-spoke route systems, and, instead, flies a point-to-point system. On the people-management side, despite being highly unionized, Southwest has been able to develop a sense of commitment and loyalty among its employees. It is not unusual to see Southwest employees go well beyond their narrowly defined job responsibilities, helping out in whatever way is necessary to get a plane off the ground safely and on time. Which of these—operational choices or Southwest’s approach to managing its people—is more likely to be a source of sustained com- petitive advantage?

Consider first Southwest’s operational choices. First, do these operational choices reduce Southwest’s costs or increase the willingness of its customers to pay—that is, are these operational choices valuable? It can be shown that most of Southwest’s operational choices have the effect of reducing its costs. For example, by flying only one type of airliner, Southwest can reduce the cost of training its maintenance staff, reduce its spare parts inventory, and reduce the time its planes are being repaired. By flying into smaller airports, Southwest reduces the fees it would otherwise have to pay to land at larger airports. Its point-to-point system of routes avoids the costs associated with establishing large hub-and-spoke systems. Overall, these opera- tional choices are valuable.
Second, are these operational choices rare? For most of its history, Southwest’s operational choices have been rare. Only recently have large incumbent airlines and smaller new entrants begun to implement similar operational choices.
Third, are these operational choices costly to imitate? Several incumbent airline firms have set up subsidiaries designed to emulate most of Southwest’s operational choices. For example, Continental created the Continental Lite division, United created the Ted division, and Delta created the Song division. All of these divisions chose a single type of airplane to fly, flew into smaller airports, adopted a point-to-point route structure, and so forth.
In addition to these incumbent airlines, many new entrants into the airline industry—both in the United States and elsewhere—have adopted similar oper- ational choices as Southwest. In the United States, these new entrants include AirTran Airlines (recently purchased by Southwest), Allegiant Airlines, JetBlue, Skybus Airlines (now bankrupt), Spirit Airlines, and Virgin American Airlines.
Thus, while Southwest’s operational choices are valuable and have been rare, they are apparently not costly to imitate. This is not surprising because these operational choices have few of the attributes of resources or capabilities that are costly to imitate. They do not derive from a firm’s unique history, they are not path dependent, they are not causally ambiguous, and they are not socially complex.
Finally, is Southwest organized to fully exploit its operational choices? Most observers agree that Southwest’s structure, management controls, and compensa- tion policies are consistent with its operational choices.
Taken together, this analysis of Southwest’s operational choices suggests that they are valuable, have been rare, but are not costly to imitate. While Southwest is organized to exploit these opportunities, they are likely to be only a source of temporary competitive advantage for Southwest.
A similar VRIO analysis can be conducted for Southwest’s approach to people management. First, is this approach valuable; that is, does it reduce Southwest’s costs or increase the willingness of its customers to pay?
Employee commitment and loyalty at Southwest is one explanation of why Southwest can get higher levels of employee productivity than most other U.S. air- lines. This increased productivity shows up in numerous ways. For example, the average turnaround time for Southwest flights is around 18 minutes. The average turnaround time for the average U.S. airline is 45 minutes. Southwest Airline employ- ees are simply more effective in unloading and loading luggage, fueling, and catering their airplanes than employees in other airlines. This means that Southwest Airlines airplanes are on the ground for less time and in the air more time than its competi- tors. Of course, an airplane is only making money if it is in the air. This seemingly simple idea is worth hundreds of millions of dollars in lower costs to Southwest.

Have such loyalty and teamwork been rare in the U.S. airline industry? Over the past 15 years, the U.S. airline industry has been wracked by employment strife. Many airlines have had to cut employment, reduce wages, and in other ways strain their relationship with their employees. Overall, in comparison to incumbent airlines, the relationship that Southwest enjoys with its employees has been rare.
Is this relationship costly to imitate? Certainly, relationships between an air- line and its employees have many of the attributes that should make them costly to imitate. They emerge over time; they are path dependent, causally ambiguous, and socially complex. It is reasonable to expect that incumbent airlines, airlines that already have strained relationships with their employees, would have difficulty imitating the relationship Southwest enjoys with its employees. Thus, in compari- son to incumbent airlines, Southwest’s approach to managing its people is probably valuable, rare, and costly to imitate. Assuming it is organized appropriately (and this seems to be the case), this would mean that—relative to incumbent airlines— Southwest has a sustained competitive advantage.
The situation may be somewhat different for new entrants into the U.S. airline industry. These airlines may not have a history of strained employee rela- tionships. As new firms, they may be able to develop more valuable employee relationships from the very beginning. This suggests that, relative to new entrants, Southwest’s approach to people management may be valuable and rare, but not costly to imitate. Again, assuming Southwest is organized appro- priately, relative to new entrants into the U.S. airline industry, Southwest’s peo- ple-management capabilities may be a source of only a temporary competitive advantage.
