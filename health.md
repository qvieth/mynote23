- Metabolism is a term that describes all the chemical reactions in your body.
  - These chemical reactions keep your body alive and functioning.
  - However, the word metabolism is often used interchangeably with metabolic rate, or the **number of calories you burn.**
  - The **higher metabolism, the more calories you burn and the easier to lose weight and keep it off.**
  - Having a high metabolism can also give you energy and make you feel better.

  - Many factors influence your metabolism, such as body size and composition, gender and age
  - **The more muscle you have, the more calories you'll burn**
  - As you age, muscle mass tends to decrease and slow down calorie burn.

- there are 3 macronutrients:
  - carbohydrates, protein, and fat. ...
  - Macronutrients are nutrients that your body needs in large amounts to function optimally.
  - All macronutrients must be obtained through diet; the body cannot produce macronutrients on its own.
- carbohydrates prevent protein from being used:

  - also prevent protein from being used as an energy source and enable fat metabolism, according to the NHS.
  - Protein only burns as the sole energy source when the body lacks carbohydrates and fats. Otherwise, the body uses protein for a number of bodily functions, including building muscle. If your daily protein intake isn't adequate, you may still lose weight but will struggle to build muscle mass. Consuming a higher amount of protein while trying to lose weight will help prevent muscle loss

  - The human body bases the order in which it burns the fats, carbohydrates and protein you give it on **three factors:**
    1. How many cells require it
    2. how much effort it takes to convert it to usable energy
    3. and how much it can store.
  - Your body burns carbohydrates before fat because they score well in all three categories
