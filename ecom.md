## 6 Critical Questions Your Business Plan Must Answer

https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/242596 <- the structure taken from here

### 1. What need are you addressing?

- [ ] be logical and critical when you consider the driving force behind your customers’ purchasing decisions: what fundamental customer need is your business addressing?
- [ ] maybe back this up with research that shows the need actually exists.

In Taiwan, organic food production is considered rare. What is considered organic food is the restriction of the usage of certain pesticides and fertilizers in farming methods. Organic foods typically are not processed using irradiation, industrial solvents, or synthetic food additives.

Pesticides are harmful to the environment. Pesticides are toxic chemicals meant to kill pest species, however, they can affect non-target species, such as plants, animals, and humans. Environmental modeling indicates that over 60% of global agricultural land is currently at risk of pesticide pollution by more than one active ingredient.

The US Fish and Wildlife Service estimates that 72 million birds are killed by pesticides in the United States each year. This leads to reductions in bird populations. The country where it relies less on pesticides shows a slower decline and in contrast, the country that relies more on pesticides shows a serious decline.

Not only birds but aquatic life is also disrupted by pesticide-contaminated water. Study shows that repeated exposure to sublethal doses of some pesticides can cause psychological and behavioral changes that reduce fish populations.

Pesticides can enter the human body through inhalation of aerosols, dust, and vapor that contain pesticides. Every human contains pesticides in its fat cells. However, compare to adults, children are more vulnerable to pesticides due to the development of the body and weaker immune systems.

Therefore, our product “Moonee” is believed to be able to solve this problem. It helps living creatures to have a healthy life and as well as to ensure the products/ food that they bought are organic. The company’s mission is to provide organic food to help the environment by 2040.

- The idea is to create an online e-commerce platform that provides “same-day delivery” to ensure the food's freshness. ((In this e-commerce platform, there is a subscription fee which is $NTD 99 a month)). The delivery method that the company uses will be couriers using scooters and truck boxes if the order exceeds the capacity. The couriers will be given a portable cool box to carry the food and/or ingredients. The customer can order it anywhere and anytime, and the ingredients will arrive the next day. For example, if an individual orders the ingredients at 10pm, the grocery will arrive at the individual house in the morning.

### 2. What makes you different?

- [ ] first do some reserach to acknowledge all the major players in your space
- [ ] acknowledge what they’re doing right, what they’re doing wrong, and how they’re going about their business. Identify the differentiating factor that will allow you to stand out, and emphasize it
- [ ] competitive advantage -> **SWOT** or **five force analysis**, -> use porter's 5 forces

**Competitors in Taiwan:**

亨源 HENG YUAN, https://www.5ayuki.com/aboutus.htm

- In 1988, this company was found with the intention of managing a “organics-only store” which was the pioneer of Taiwan's healthy diet.
- As the trend goes well, in 1922, this brand started to focus more on the organic and natural food’s invention, manufacture, import, export, and retailing.

Foodpanda

- Foodpanda somehow is one of competitors, which cooperates with A-mart, Carrefour, OK mart, and so forth retailing stores in order to deliver the ingredients to customers

In the paragraph before, it shows some of the competitive advantages that the company has. In addition, the company provides healthiness, freshness, and convenience for those people who show concern towards the environment and want to live healthily. Some of the grocery lists for sale are vegetables and beans. The company will cooperate with several different farmers that are located in Taiwan. Another aspect of concern is how we would store the products for customers after the arrival of the delivery. Our solution to this issue is that customers can purchase a reusable and portable box (like the foodpanda delivery box) from us at an affordable price for only one time. Then their orders would be placed in their box placed in front of their house. Also, we would suggest the buyers to put their portable cool box in front of their house the night before the delivery date to avoid being stolen.

### 3. Who is your audience?

- [ ] Think about factors like age, sex, education, geographic location, working status, marital status, and perform some preliminary market research to determine the best path forward.
- [ ] can change over time, don't stay too committed to a niche

The company business model is created for all-aged people located in Taiwan. It will provide organic food that is available on the e-commerce platform. The advantage of our e-commerce platform is that it provides all kinds of payment methods (cash, credit card, and EasyCard). The business would be B2C.

### 4. How is your business going to make money?

- [ ] **business model** — a fancy term that means how they'll make money -> state your business model here
- [ ] how are you going to sell? Where are you going to sell? How much are you going to sell for?
- [ ] operating expenses? Who are you going to pay? What services or partners will you need to pay for? And ultimately, will the amount you sell be able to surpass the amount you owe? When will you break even?

- The major revenue for the company is from the number of customers. In addition, our subscription fee would be minor revenue for our company. The revenue stream is observable with the help of technology. The e-commerce platform will be available on desktop, app-store, and play store.

### 5. How will you promote your business?

- [ ] Do they rely on traditional advertising or online marketing?
- [ ] Do they attend tradeshows and local events, or use technology to spread the word about their existence?

**DEVELOPE OUR MARKETING STRATEGY HERE**

Marketing Strategy

note : this part is to answer question number 10-11

For the e-commerce platform, the company will use google analytics or google keyword planner to see the website engagement as well as the website rate. In addition, the company will use a popular advertising site which is GoogleAds. It will also use PPC (Pay Per Click) where the company doesn’t have to pay for the advertisement fee unless someone visits the website. The average cost for CPC (Google Search Network) is $1-$2 per click while the CPC for Google Display Network is $1 or less per click. In addition, the company will use SEO to increase its engagement. The SEO cost on average is around US$75–2500 a month.

Not only will the company rely on the website for the marketing strategy but the company will also rely on the social media platform for the marketing strategy. The company will hire some famous social media influencers (take turns) and to use them continuously for around 6 months. The purpose of this continuous marketing is to ensure that the hype only lasts for a moment, but rather it will last forever and to let them have customers with brand loyalty.

The social media that the company will use is Facebook. The reason behind Facebook is because it provides an advanced business advertisement. While the reason behind Instagram is due to the popularity within the youth. The purpose why the company focuses more on the youth is because the youth is the future of the world.

**Business promotion plan**

Subscription fee: $NTD99

1. You do subscribe, you

Customer discount: spent more than $ 200, you can get a discount in price, and the maximum amount would be $ 50.

Customers would be divided into several segments with different amounts of vouchers offered monthly, namely gold level customers with 20 vouchers, silver level customers with 14 vouchers, bronze level customers with 5 vouchers, etc.

Voucher includes a variety of vouchers, including

1. Money discount
2. Free samples/ box of organic products
3.

(Maybe we can combine the ideas together)

### 6. What do you need to get started?

- [ ] Do you need any advanced equipment? Who will you need to hire? How much will you need for an initial run?

### 7. Appendix:

- [ ] meaning behind the name
  - Moonee is an e-commerce platform service for organic food. The word Moonee is the word-play of the word moon and money. As the moon orbits around the earth every month, the image will remind customers of our subscription-based service; we are the part of our customers’ life; we orbit around their life every month, or week. And all they have to pay is money, not their time. Our big mission is to make our customers go crazy with organic food and make it a part of our customer’s life.
- [ ] mission statement
- [ ] milestone
- [ ] any things other than the first 6 question
