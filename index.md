## principles

- snapshot system(chronological-based) vs categorize system(relevant-based) : i'm testing the new way to organize knowledge

1. ask what to learn and can it be practiced daily
2. book review: write subjective reactions, not objective truths
3. name it to tame it
   - constantly ask: what is this emotion -> what tone of voice? -> what facial expression?
   - emotion tells us what to pay attention to
   - Emotions are often confused with feelings and moods, but the three terms are not interchangeable.

12. [emotion in psychology terms](https://online.uwa.edu/news/emotional-psychology/)
    - Emotions are often confused with feelings and moods, but the three terms are not interchangeable
      - A feeling is the result of an emotion and may be influenced by memories, beliefs and other factors.
      - A mood is described by the APA as “any short-lived emotional state, usually of low intensity.” Moods differ from emotions because they lack stimuli and have no clear starting point
      - Defining emotions is a task that is not yet complete. Many researchers are still proposing theories about what makes up our emotions, and existing theories are constantly being challenged.
      - Still, there’s a good basis of knowledge to analyze when exploring the topic.
    - American Psychological Association(APA) defined emotion as a reaction pattern involving:
      - subjective experience: aka stimulus
      - and physiological response: reaction, result of autonomic nervous system
      - behavioral response: result of the emotional process
    - our ability to understand others’ behavioral responses plays a huge role in our emotional intelligence, which will be discussed in more detail later.
    - https://www.verywellmind.com/what-are-emotions-2795178
    - That is why it’s important that we’re able to understand emotions as they play such an important role in how we behave.
    - Emotional intelligence is the ability to perceive, control and evaluate emotions
    - The term was first coined by researchers Peter Salovey and John D. Mayer and found popularity through Dan Goleman’s 1996 book
    - Emotions motivate people to respond quickly to stimuli in the environment, which helps improve the chances of success and survival.
