- [literature review](literature-review)
- choose smalelr population, like student of MCU
  Statistics is very big, so try to learn only those topics that are really required to built your stats background.
- some important topics are:
  1. Types of distribution- normal, chi square, pdf etc
  2. 2. sampling techniques- random, stratified etc
  3. T test, hypothesis testing, Annova, normality test, chi square test and some important theorem like Central limit theorem, likelihood estimation etc
  4. Regression(linear and logistics)
  5. Classification and segmentation using clustering and decision tree
  6. Time series (advance topic)

## 1st day

-> moodle : -> syllabus

- text requirement: select from the 2 textbook:

  - research topics -> research questions -> make sure that question(or hypothesis) is testable
  - https://www.thoughtco.com/testable-hypothesis-explanation-and-examples-609100 - Now that you know what a testable hypothesis is, here are tips for proposing one:
    - ...
    - 2 variables and how they are related
  - what is the criteria for grading projects? is that the easy research question receive the same grade as the hard one?

## 2nd week

PPT summary below

### from problem statement to research questions

statement of the problem

- this should include :
  1. a clear statement that the problem exists
  2. evidence that supports the existence of the problem
  3. evidence of an existing trends that has led to the problem
  4. difinitions of major concepts and terms
  5. ... screenshot

### statement of the problem

this should include some of the followings:

1. a clear statement that the problem exists
2. evidence that supports the existence of the problem
3. evidence of an existring trend that has led to the rpboblemment
4. defifnitions of major concpets and terms( this can be provieded below in a subsection)
5. a clear description of the setting, and probable causes related to the problem, and
6. a specific and feasible solution statement

### stating the research problem

- state the problem in the opening paragraph (e.e., something that needs a solution)
- identitfy an issue:
  - research-based research problem
  - practical problems
- reference the problem using the literature

- common pitfall: defining the problem based on the solution
- read an article quickly state out what is opening , transition

next week : each group has 2 to 3 minutes to talk about how your team come from problem statement to research question - any topics you're interesting in each group need to prepare your 3 sentences to talk about ideas, please prepare your inverted triangle - prepare PPT

1. the opening
2. transition
3. research quetion(s)

NEGATIVE SIDE OF SOCIAL MEDIA:

- information overload -> social media fatigue -> fear of covid19
- the fear of missing out (FOMO) buffered the impact of social media fatigue and fear of COVID-19 on Gen Z usersâ€™ social media discontinuance intention
- discontinuance intention: bad psychological state which the subject has short attention-span during focus session

WHAT PROBLEM WE CAN FOCUS:

- **information overload** may induce negative personal states: dissatisfaction, social media fatigue, these can lead to negative behavioural changes: such as overuse(bad for user), reduced usage(bad for social platform provider) and or abandoned usage of social media(also bad for social platform provider)

WHAT WE CAN SOLVE:

- we can try to suggest users, platform providers the sustainable use of social media during and after pandemic time
