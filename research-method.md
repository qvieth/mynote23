# research method | 91302 | 99612 | Rrof. Yan Ming Shu | d5:6,7,8 |

- choose smalelr population, like student of MCU
  Statistics is very big, so try to learn only those topics that are really required to built your stats background.
- some important topics are:
  1. Types of distribution- normal, chi square, pdf etc
  2. 2. sampling techniques- random, stratified etc
  3. T test, hypothesis testing, Annova, normality test, chi square test and some important theorem like Central limit theorem, likelihood estimation etc
  4. Regression(linear and logistics)
  5. Classification and segmentation using clustering and decision tree
  6. Time series (advance topic)

## 1st day

-> moodle : -> syllabus

- text requirement: select from the 2 textbook:

  - research methodology ranjit jumar 4th
  - the essential of statistics: joseph F. healey 2nd
  - basic econometrics : damodar N. Gujarati -> heavy and big -> prof select only a few topic
  - various scholarly article

- 3 assignment for this course : due on TBA
- course schedule
- every 6 week, you are expect to hand in the report
  - on oct 28, hand in the first project
  - on dec 10, the second
  - on jan 14, third final mini project

PPT :

- research methods

### the process

- next week: in class
- second to week
- moodle
- things to dicuss:
  - research topics -> research questions -> make sure that question(or hypothesis) is testable
  - https://www.thoughtco.com/testable-hypothesis-explanation-and-examples-609100 - Now that you know what a testable hypothesis is, here are tips for proposing one:
    - ...
    - 2 variables and how they are related
  - what is the criteria for grading projects? is that the easy research question receive the same grade as the hard one?

## 2nd week

PPT summary below

### from problem statement to research questions

statement of the problem

- this should include :
  1. a clear statement that the problem exists
  2. evidence that supports the existence of the problem
  3. evidence of an existing trends that has led to the problem
  4. difinitions of major concepts and terms
  5. ... screenshot

### statement of the problem

this should include some of the followings:

1. a clear statement that the problem exists
2. evidence that supports the existence of the problem
3. evidence of an existring trend that has led to the rpboblemment
4. defifnitions of major concpets and terms( this can be provieded below in a subsection)
5. a clear description of the setting, and probable causes related to the problem, and
6. a specific and feasible solution statement

### stating the research problem

- state the problem in the opening paragraph (e.e., something that needs a solution)
- identitfy an issue:
  - research-based research problem
  - practical problems
- reference the problem using the literature

- common pitfall: defining the problem based on the solution
- read an article quickly state out what is opening , transition

next week : each group has 2 to 3 minutes to talk about how your team come from problem statement to research question - any topics you're interesting in each group need to prepare your 3 sentences to talk about ideas, please prepare your inverted triangle - prepare PPT

1. the opening
2. transition
3. research quetion(s)

NEGATIVE SIDE OF SOCIAL MEDIA:

- information overload -> social media fatigue -> fear of covid19
- the fear of missing out (FOMO) buffered the impact of social media fatigue and fear of COVID-19 on Gen Z users’ social media discontinuance intention
- discontinuance intention: bad psychological state which the subject has short attention-span during focus session

WHAT PROBLEM WE CAN FOCUS:

- **information overload** may induce negative personal states: dissatisfaction, social media fatigue, these can lead to negative behavioural changes: such as overuse(bad for user), reduced usage(bad for social platform provider) and or abandoned usage of social media(also bad for social platform provider)

WHAT WE CAN SOLVE:

- we can try to suggest users, platform providers the sustainable use of social media during and after pandemic time

## gendered communication

women and men communicate differently

- what we think and what we behave are differently
- Gender Differences in Speech Content:
  - research into gendered communication started only about 50 years ago
  - Men tend to a “report” style, meaning they use speech that contains facts, data and aims to solve problems. They tend to leave out personal information or anecdotes. They also tend to try to dominate a conversation
  - communication researchers have only been examining it for about 50 years. Initially, research centered on the differences between men and women’s language styles
  - Building on that, we began to analyze the concepts of dominance and control. Today, most research in this area focuses on identity formation, multiplicities, and similarities. 
  - Gender attitudes are confusing. What does it mean to be masculine? What does it mean to be feminine? What are your attitudes?

https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0093650215590605 Gendered Communication and Career Outcomes:
- Results generally support our hypotheses that masculine communication style is related to hierarchical advancement
  - (e.g., number of promotions, advancement to higher managerial levels),
- whereas feminine communication style is related to non-hierarchical rewards
  - (e.g., higher compensation, increased span of control)
- Unexpectedly, feminine communication style also positively predicts two indicators of hierarchical career success.
- Furthermore, an interaction effect suggests that gendered communication style has more of an impact on women’s compensation than on men’s.

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277953603005902 gendered communication in sexual health, partners
- Effective communication between partners is crucial for good sexual health, but is often difﬁcult to achieve
- social pressures that exacerbate gendered communication


evidence : 2 ways from other paper, content analysis

Unlike sex, which is classified based on genetic and biological factors, gender is learned and performed (J. T. Wood, 2013)

While extant research has considered gender as a socially constructed, learned concept, it has largely ignored the performative nature of the gender construct, result-
ing in a rather narrow understanding of the relationship between gender and organizational phenomena (Mumby, 2006).

On one hand, career advancement theory suggests that masculinity tends to predict career success (Fagenson, 1990; Tharenou, 1997b).

These differing theoretical perspectives reflect contrasting alternatives through which to predict career outcomes

Kirchmeyer (2002) finds masculinity to be positively related to promotion rate but not to income

Furthermore, leadership literature suggests that femininity has become more universally desirable (Elsesser & Lever, 2011) and that androgynous individuals (those who possess both high masculine and high feminine characteristics) tend to emerge as organizational leaders (Kent & Moss, 1994)

Gendered Communication and Career Outcomes:

```
A is dependent variable (in our case it's Advancement of positions)
B C D E F G are independent variable

after doing survey we will have A B C D E F 
then we create pairs of dependent and independent variables to see which one leads to change
6 pairs are:  A-B | A-C | A-D | A-E | A-F 

        A ▲                             A ▲                                A ▲                             A ▲                              A ▲

- we gathered and discussed topic, after we choose the topic we do some more preliminary reserach to find out which problems interested us

Hello professor, hello class, we are team 6
