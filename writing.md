Sit back, and continue to think.
That’s where the writing gets done.

- [what is a thesis statement](https://rasmussen.libanswers.com/faq/32467)
- Your thesis statement belongs at the end of your first paragraph, also known as your introduction.
- Your readers—especially your instructors—want to read writing that engages them. Consequently, you must write thesis statements that are **arguable, not factual**
- Statements of fact seem easy to write about because, well, they are easy to prove
- After all, they’re facts.
- The problem is that you cannot write engaging papers around statements of fact.
- Such theses prevent you from demonstrating critical thinking and analytical skills,
- which you want to show your instructor.
- If you were to write a paper around the next two statements,
- your writing would probably be quite dull because you would be restating facts that the general public already knows.
- Besides typical essay components like an introduction and conclusion, a good analytical essay will include:
  - A thesis that states your main argument
  - Analysis that relates back to your thesis and supports it
  - Examples to support your analysis and allow a more in-depth look at the issue
- In the rest of this article, we’ll explain how to include each of these in your analytical essay.

- Periodic vs. Loose Sentences: What Are the Differences?
  - Both feature independent clauses and dependent clauses

- the way to think:
  - not one idea then the next ideas and so on...
  - but many ideas at the same times then think of transitions or conjunctions to connect them
- The main difference between conjunctions and transitions is that conjunctions connect two clauses, but transitions connect two sentences or paragraphs.
- conjunction: coordinating conjunctions(FANBOYS) and subordinating conjunctions.
- transition connect ideas : they can be words, phrases, or sentences.
