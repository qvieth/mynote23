## Identify themes, debates and gaps

We, as twenties first centuries born children, found a fact that is shocking for us: before 1920, women could not vote, attend college, or pursue training for most professions. Gender stereotype or sexism is one among the issue that is controversial and consistently appear across cultures(Williams & Best, 1990). Although the attitude among people of our current time is much more advanced than which of the past, the scurf of yesterday's prejudice remains. There is still unequal power distribution between men and women among organizational's hierarchies. Many top positions of companies are still filled with men. Among skills used in the workplace that determine whether one advance or not in their career position, communication is considered the single most important(Williams, 2011, p.574). Together with intimate the relationship found between culture, gender, and communication(T. Wood & Oraiz, 2018). Using the already defined styles of gendered communication from the previous research, we step further to investigate what leads to the unequal distribution of power among the 2 genders.

Although sex and gender are commonly used interchangeably, American Psychology Association does distinguish gender from sex: sex refers to biological traits, while genders refer to cultural ones; and from that, male and female, masculinity and femininity, although they sound like they are stating the same idea, are also different aspects of human characteristics. For example, gender, culture, and communication in the scope of society are highly connected, each correlates and influences the other (T. Wood & Oraiz, 2018).
Gender isn’t really about males and females; it’s about the meaning our culture attaches to each sex. Therefore, it can be learned.

View of masculinity and femininity is different based on the view of a different culture from a different era, for example, the ideal body image of a woman was desired differently from a different era. In the 1950s, fuller-figured women exemplified feminine and sexiness. But in today's modern society, the image being desired is on another polar. Many views of masculinity and femininity can also be easily recognized that the concept varies over time.

In addition to expressing cultural views of gender, language is a primary means by which we express our gendered identities. By looking at the relationship established between gender and communication, especially verbal communication, we dig deeper into how people use verbal communication to express their genders that are masculinity and femininity.

Gendered styles of communicating are not necessarily sex-based styles. For instance, although most girls are socialized to communicate primarily in feminine ways, some girls learn ­masculine modes of communicating; although most boys are encouraged to cultivate primarily masculine styles of communicating, some boys learn feminine modes. Also, some people work to become fluent in both masculine and feminine modes of communication, and some people perform identities that are beyond the conventional of their natural gender (T. Wood & Oraiz, 2018).

Julia T. Wood categorized 2 gendered communication styles based on research identified by others.  Feminine communication, a style commonly used by feminine speech communities, has 7 major features: maintain the relationship, show empathy, support others, maintain interactions, encourage elaboration, facilitate closeness and create open doors for others to respond. While Masculine Communication used by masculine speech communities has 6 functions: establish status and control, accomplish instrumental objectives, interrupt to show conversational commands, tend to be direct and assertive, tend to be more abstract, also less emotionally responsive

Masculine speech tends to ­follow a linear pattern, in which major points in a story are presented sequentially to get to the climax. Talk tends to be straightforward without much detail. The rules of feminine speech, however, call for more detailed, less linear storytelling. Because feminine and masculine rules about storytelling differ, men may find feminine accounts wandering and tedious. Conversely, the masculine style of storytelling may strike women as leaving out all the interesting particulars.

By figuring out which traits lead to better advancement in a career position. The result of this research could be used to determine which gendered characteristics should be the focus for one to learn to gain the advantage. Also, encourage people to use different styles of communication so that we can be more versatile and effective in our everyday interactions with others in society.

- In reviewing the literature on social media and body image, you note that:
  - Most research has focused on young women.
  - There is an increasing interest in the visual aspects of social media.
  - But there is still a lack of robust research on highly visual platforms like Instagram and Snapchat—this is a gap that you could address in your own research.

## Outline the structure

Characterizations of women and men that comprise descriptive gender stereotypes are remarkably consistent across cultures (Williams & Best, 1990). -> MJ pls make a literature review of this
The research did find relationships between culture, gender, and communication (T. Wood & Oraiz, 2018); among the relationships found, there is gendered communication:  a bias that creates inequality or inefficiency in communication between different genders. Gendered communication is defined based on the stereotypes related to each gender (T. Wood & Oraiz, 2018), and many negative impacts can be found as a result of the bias. Communication about sexual health is avoided (Cicely Marston, 2004) is one among the negative impacts.

- Effective communication between partners is crucial for good sexual health but is often difficult to achieve
- This qualitative study shows how gendered communication can act as an important barrier to successful dialogue between men and women
- Both content and manner of speaking are often gendered:
  - not only can topics of conversation be socially defined as
    - more or less appropriate for a speaker according to his or her sex
  - but men and women can also differ systematically in terms of the phrases and words they use
- This may lead to a **lack of the common forms of expression that are needed for effective communication**
- The study examines communication about sexuality among young men and women in low-income areas of Mexico City

- The relationship between gender stereotypes of sexual behaviour and the gendered nature of communication strategies is explored

- The negative consequences of gendered communication for effective dialogue between men and women are illustrated
- Interventions that can enhance communication between men and women would be expected to have a positive impact on sexual health
- 
- This paper argues that research and interventions intended to improve sexual health may instead inadvertently reinforce communication barriers
  - not only by failing to address the social pressures that exacerbate gendered communication
  - but also more insidiously, by using language that actively contributes to these pressures
- An example of an intervention that avoids this problem is the Mexican programme ‘‘Gente Joven’’ (‘‘Young People’’)


- As prejudice about gender, especially communication regarded, is a remaining issue in this modern era, we conduct this study about gender communication in the context of workplace in order to firgure out which factors cause the dominant number of male leader.
- 
- it is important to consider who the more effective communicator is so that we can 
learn from each other on how to communicate better. Noller (1980) found that there is a 
connection between a couple’s marital adjustment and their skill at communication. She 
had each participant first take the Marital Adjustment Test (Locke & Wallace, 1959) to 
determine their overall marital satisfaction. Then, after the couples’ communication was 
studied, the results showed that those with low marital adjustment demonstrated 
considerably fewer good nonverbal communications than those with high marital 
adjustment. However, the question must be raised: Do couples have a higher marital 
adjustment because they have good communication, or do couples have good 
communication because they are happy within their marriage?

To participate in changing society, we cannot limit ourselves to our personal identities
and experiences. We need to learn about the experiences, perspectives, and circumstances of
people in other social positions
