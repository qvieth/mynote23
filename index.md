Hypothetical GM's Hummer SWOT Matrix

- Hummer was primarily a US-focused brand of rugged SUVs and SUTs

|            | opportunity | threat |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------ |
|            | 1           | 2      |
| strength   | 3           | 4      |
| weaknesses | 5           | 6      |

- 1. opportunity for Hummer in China:
  - China's infrastructure of roads and buildings have been improving lately
  - China had been building its infrastructure of roads and buildings at an unprecedented rate
- 2. competition from new & foreign automaker
  - demand is limited in china due to premium pricing and taxes of 100% from chinese government imposed on foreign-produce-vehicles
  - model size differcult to get through narrow and congested roads
  - government polices were not favourable to Hummer
  - Attack by Environmentalists
  - Oil Spike
- 3. as china's road improving, SUVs model size becoming suitable
- 4. Hummer is an American iconic brand
  - primarily a US-focused brand of rugged SUVs and SUTs,
- 6. Hummer's parent company long car-development lead times

  - slow in responding to customers’ changing preferences for more fuel-efficient cars,
  - low brand differentiation among parent's company core products
  - high salary cost, low work productivity
  - customer lifestyle changes
  - increasing oil prices and tightening government regulations on car emissions prompted rapid growth in compact and subcompact sedans at the expense of larger vehicles, including crossover SUV
  - The government's supporting for hybrid or fully electric cars and buses

- Meanwhile, China, with 1.3 billion people
  and a booming economy, had experienced strong growth in sales of light vehicles since 2001.
- highly fragmented auto industry with manufacturers of all sizes auto
- New entrants were discouraged from entering the industry due to government control in issuing new vehicle-production licences, though a company could get around this by buying a small auto manufacturer that already had a valid licence. Therefore Tengzhong acquiring Hummer could be a strategy to get around the government discouragement.

- objective:
  - transform Hummer from a US-focused brand into a global icon and expand its presence in China.

## fleeting notes

## principles

- snapshot system(chronological-based) vs categorize system(relevant-based) : i'm testing the new way to organize knowledge

1. ask what to learn and can it be practiced daily
2. book review: write subjective reactions, not objective truths
3. name it to tame it
   - constantly ask: what is this emotion -> what tone of voice? -> what facial expression?
   - emotion tells us what to pay attention to
   - Emotions are often confused with feelings and moods, but the three terms are not interchangeable.
4. [Basic Economics](Basic-Economics)
5. clear thinking becomes clear writing... it's impossible for a muddy thinker to write good english.
6. communication : kill vs kiss
7. decision making framework :
   1. solve a problems, topics?
   2. -> google top 10 books of ...
   3. -> summary of the book
   4. -> pick the good book to read
   5. how to get quick insight, read summary, review, take their insights
8. [decision making science books](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=decision+making+science+books)
9. [emotional intelligence](emotional-intelligence)
10. your actions have consequences
11. [who coined the term introvert](https://www.simplypsychology.org/introvert-extrovert.html) : 3/1 ratios of extro/intro <- this is bullshit
12. [emotion in psychology terms](https://online.uwa.edu/news/emotional-psychology/)
    - Emotions are often confused with feelings and moods, but the three terms are not interchangeable
      - A feeling is the result of an emotion and may be influenced by memories, beliefs and other factors.
      - A mood is described by the APA as “any short-lived emotional state, usually of low intensity.” Moods differ from emotions because they lack stimuli and have no clear starting point
      - Defining emotions is a task that is not yet complete. Many researchers are still proposing theories about what makes up our emotions, and existing theories are constantly being challenged.
      - Still, there’s a good basis of knowledge to analyze when exploring the topic.
    - American Psychological Association(APA) defined emotion as a reaction pattern involving:
      - subjective experience: aka stimulus
      - and physiological response: reaction, result of autonomic nervous system
      - behavioral response: result of the emotional process
    - our ability to understand others’ behavioral responses plays a huge role in our emotional intelligence, which will be discussed in more detail later.
    - https://www.verywellmind.com/what-are-emotions-2795178
    - That is why it’s important that we’re able to understand emotions as they play such an important role in how we behave.
    - Emotional intelligence is the ability to perceive, control and evaluate emotions
    - The term was first coined by researchers Peter Salovey and John D. Mayer and found popularity through Dan Goleman’s 1996 book
    - Emotions motivate people to respond quickly to stimuli in the environment, which helps improve the chances of success and survival.
