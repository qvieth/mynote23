- the basket of goods primarily takes into account purchases made by urban consumers. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the CPI reflects the spending habits of two population groups: all urban consumers and urban wage earners and clerical workers. The all urban consumer group represents approximately 93% of the total U.S. population based on the expenditures of professionals, the self-employed, the unemployed, wage earners, and clerical workers. The CPI does not include the spending habits of people living in rural areas, those from agricultural households, people in the Armed Forces, and people in institutions such as prisons and mental hospitals.
